# Profile

Different views:
- If you are logged in and it's yours [[Profile_Mine]]
- If you are logged in and it's someone else's [[Profile_Auth]]
- If you are not logged in [[Profile_NoAuth]]

In all cases, we need to show:
- Profile photo
- Name
- Contact Details / Linktree-esque
- User manual information
