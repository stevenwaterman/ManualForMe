# The Project
- I can't work on a project that doesn't **interest** me
- I'd rather work on one big feature than lots of small ones
	- Hard to answer
- I couldn't work on a project that I thought was unethical
	- Rephrase to this
- You can't succeed if you don't finish
	- Should be phrased more clearly
	- A project can be successful even though it didn't achieve its goal
- Users generally know what the main problems are
	- Rephrased
- I need to know how things work under the hood
	- Different category?
- **Vision and direction is important**
- **In favour of postponing**
- I work best on predictable projects, where we can safely say where we'll be in a month's time
	- Broad overview is useful
	- enjoys improvising
- Better to be late or bad?

# My Team
- Work better alone but able to access support rather than having to constantly ask and tell people
- Happy to be on a team if there's subtle/no hierarchy so I can take a dominant stance in some areas without feeling like i'm breaking the system
- Open to everyone's ideas, happy to have socialness in the work atmosphere, less formal, could go on a tangent about a dog or jokes

- I work best when I'm told what to do in detail
	- Yes when not an expert
	- No when an expert
- I appreciate when people reach out and offer support spontaneously
	- As above
- I prefer when there is a clear hierarchy and defined roles
	- Should be 2 questions
- I end up talking to everyone on the team, even though we don't really work together
	- Maybe unnecessary? You'd notice
- I try to avoid team politics
- Work is work, my colleagues aren't my friends
	- I try to keep my work life and my social life separate
- I should feel a sense of belonging in my team
	- Interpreted as more about the role in the team
- You should be loyal to your team
	- Uncomfortable telling people
- I don't keep any secrets from my team and I expect them to be open with me too
	- Shit question. Make more about transparency
- My success is the team's success, and vice-versa
	- Shit question. Make more about collectivism vs individualism
- I need my contributions to be recognised


# My Work
- Not repetitive
- Need for learning and personal growth

- I'm better at starting things than finishing them
	- Rephrase to be more about when you'd want to be working
- I need a plan before I'm comfortable starting
	- Rephrase 'I wouldn't want to act until there's a plan'
- I'm most productive during a crisis
	- Rephrase to be more about energised + what is a crisis?
- I can easily juggle many tasks at once
	- Hard to answer, but managed
- I'm drained by social interaction and need time to recharge
	- Separate batteries
- I do my best work alone
	- Confusing? "i'm at my best when working on a task with others"
- I'm naturally supportive, and will jump in to help others without being asked
	- Wrong category
- I avoid conflict at all costs
	- Wrong category?
- I take on more work than I can handle
	- Wasn't obvious that the opposite was having nothing to do
- I'd prefer if every day was the same
	- Category? Delegatey
- I'm happy to work on a task even though we won't see the results any time soon
	- Phrasing - an example of time

10:07:51 - You:

oh, It works. I don't really know how I did that. Okay. Well, there's Miller. I said, Metals document. I don't really need to take note of the transcripts here. I guess I've even got a VOD. As long as I'm not playing like copyrighted music. Imagine. What kind of weirdo wouldn't play copyrighted music? That's so cool. The way that works. we just got like a Google, copyrighted music. Imagine. What kind of weirdo wouldn't play copyrighted music? That's so cool. The way that works. We just got like a Google, literally just get like a Google box. look, I even puts on a picture in Oh my God. Did. Oh Miller. Hi. Hello.

  

10:08:46 - Miller Power:

Hello.

  

10:08:46 - You:

Hello, I hear you.

  

10:08:49 - Miller Power:

Well, I can't hear you. That's fun, isn't it?

  

10:08:51 - You:

Well. It might be my fault.

  

10:08:56 - Miller Power:

Oh well.

  

10:08:58 - You:

Is it my fault? No, it seems I don't really know. It seems like it's working. It must be working for the transcript works. Yeah. Good. I'm glad that you guys here.

  

10:09:14 - Miller Power:

It's because I've muted Google meet because I was doing an event where I

  

10:09:17 - You:

Wow.

  

10:09:17 - Miller Power:

needed Google meet to be muted because I was streaming it.

  

10:09:19 - You:

I remember I watched it.

  

10:09:21 - Miller Power:

Oh, thanks.

  

10:09:23 - You:

No worries. It was, it was interesting. I enjoyed I enjoyed the usernames and

  

10:09:26 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:09:27 - You:

twitch chat was just like shovel man, 1966.

  

10:09:32 - Miller Power:

They all made, like accounts, especially to be there, to be honest.

  

10:09:34 - You:

Yeah, yeah. You could tell Oh, hi.

  

10:09:41 - Miller Power:

hi, I'm just eating some porridge

  

10:09:44 - You:

Okay.

  

10:09:45 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:09:45 - You:

That's fine. I'm just gonna, I'm not gonna go

  

10:09:47 - Miller Power:

Mm-hmm.

  

10:09:48 - You:

through these questions directly because I'd rather just ask you kind of the top level questions and see what kind of things you say to see whether.

  

10:09:55 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:09:56 - You:

It's It's not covering things that I don't need to or kind of that kind of thing.

  

10:10:01 - Miller Power:

Sure.

  

10:10:05 - You:

And I feel like the BIOS fairly self-explanatory, name pronouns photo contact details.

  

10:10:10 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I feel like you've got them.

  

10:10:11 - You:

Yeah. Yeah. Tagline, would you give yourself a tagline? I guess. It's like your Twitter bio. Isn't it?

  

10:10:19 - Miller Power:

Yeah, was and oh, well, I was supposed to say like the LinkedIn. Well, I don't want to sound like I'm obsessed with LinkedIn.

  

10:10:24 - You:

Oh my God.

  

10:10:25 - Miller Power:

Everyone.

  

10:10:25 - You:

What's my LinkedIn? I don't even know what my LinkedIn

  

10:10:26 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:10:27 - You:

is. Don't have a look.

  

10:10:29 - Miller Power:

I never go on LinkedIn, but everyone's always like kind of baby friends on LinkedIn.

  

10:10:34 - You:

we will keep trying to hire me on

  

10:10:34 - Miller Power:

What?

  

10:10:35 - You:

LinkedIn but otherwise, ignore it.

  

10:10:38 - Miller Power:

No one tries to hire me on Lincoln.

  

10:10:39 - You:

oh my My link to this is developer at NHS, which isn't true. So hopefully I'll be better than that.

  

10:10:48 - Miller Power:

Can't I can't log in sorry to like look up me but thankfully, no one has my name. I'm an archeology ma Grandview and at Durham University, which is a shite, isn't it?

  

10:11:01 - You:

Yeah, I feel like I put more effort into my Twitter credit tagline. I did my link in one.

  

10:11:06 - Miller Power:

Yeah, well, I don't know.

  

10:11:07 - You:

I mean that I put on I put one does. I'm professionally Sports so

  

10:11:13 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah, what is my Twitter one? Says look, My professional

  

10:11:18 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah, what is my Twitter one? Says look, My professional Twitter mind. Archeology Masters, graduated Roman gender and theoretical stuff, lgbq disabled, director of some companies. So yeah, maybe I put something like that. Yeah, it was for work. I'd probably put like, you know, the especially because I'm an academic, I put like the field that I work on and then also the other professional things I do like consultancy, I guess.

  

10:11:46 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:11:46 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:11:49 - You:

Is that? I don't really know what. I see the tagline is being used for. in the kind of the main point of this site is Discussing kind of how you work. Not what you do. like, I've kind of deliberately not questions about like programming languages or topics you focus on.

  

10:12:13 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I figured you had it there so you could make sure you got the right person.

  

10:12:21 - You:

And for me, it was more of a kind of introductory sentence. it was a kind of like first line of my CV says something. I've realized now that my website is broken, first line of my CV says, track proven, General is able to

  

10:12:39 - Miller Power:

Breath.

  

10:12:40 - You:

quickly learn new tech or languages and across many domains. It's again not really. Not really listen. Okay so tagline I'm that's just say I'm not really sure not really sure what this is for. I'm gonna put that in your document on this one. What was the tagline for? Is it for? Like checking, you've got the right person. revering languages slash, domains Etc, or is it for An introduction. Who you are and how you act. That's not. And yo, here you are and your personality. Yeah. Is it an executive summary of the rest of this page visit

  

10:13:39 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:13:42 - You:

Okay, cool. What kind of contact details would you put on that? Assuming some some would be public but you also have the option of making them private and only shown to some people.

  

10:13:56 - Miller Power:

Um, Well, I put my email. Publicly because that's already publicly available because that's what Academia is. But I don't know if it's the same in Programming. And then I might have my, I don't know, I don't really text people. I normally like we normally talk on like I probably put my Discord privately and maybe like maybe my phone number for like Telegram.

  

10:14:21 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:14:22 - Miller Power:

But I wouldn't expect people to call me. I've expect them to add me on telegram, or Whatsapp or whatever.

  

10:14:28 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:14:29 - Miller Power:

But normally I just coordinate that separately, like, I just expecting some message me. So yeah, maybe I just put my email on my Discord.

  

10:14:38 - You:

oh,

  

10:14:40 - Miller Power:

Or maybe like my Twitter if people want DM me. But I don't know if that counts as

  

10:14:44 - You:

Yeah, I guess like LinkedIn as well.

  

10:14:45 - Miller Power:

contact.

  

10:14:46 - You:

Maybe

  

10:14:47 - Miller Power:

Um, yeah, but I never check it. So I wouldn't put it, but I'm sure other people would put it.

  

10:14:52 - You:

you have the option? Yeah.

  

10:14:53 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:14:54 - You:

Okay, cool. That works for me. I'm yeah basebreaker tell me your likes and dislikes Etc. Something that would maybe spark a conversation on the first day. Give me somebody to talk to you about.

  

10:15:16 - Miller Power:

f\*\*\*. I don't know. Who it was? I suppose when I meet people who aren't archaeologists, I tell them. About my research because it's quite unique. but, That's not really relevant in this situation. I've got to pretend to be a programmer.

  

10:15:38 - You:

No, no district. Is your archaeologist?

  

10:15:41 - Miller Power:

All right. Yeah, but people are looking at it

  

10:15:43 - You:

And other archaeologists will be

  

10:15:44 - Miller Power:

professionally

  

10:15:44 - You:

looking at this. Yeah.

  

10:15:45 - Miller Power:

Yeah. But also I suppose other potential like people who are looking for consultants and stuff. So maybe I would put

  

10:15:53 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:15:55 - Miller Power:

About my research. But that's that's sort of a work thing and you want more fun things. I do anything fun.

  

10:16:01 - You:

I don't know.

  

10:16:05 - Miller Power:

I don't know.

  

10:16:05 - You:

That's fine. If like, Part of what I'm trying to gauge here. Is this easy or difficult?

  

10:16:11 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I don't know what I put. I'm sure other people have their ice breakers because they probably go to more like f\*\*\*\*\*\* team building

  

10:16:16 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:16:16 - Miller Power:

things that I do. But

  

10:16:19 - You:

Okay. Does that? Yeah, you don't know.

  

10:16:26 - Miller Power:

No, I don't.

  

10:16:29 - You:

Maybe would it be more helpful if it had kind of pointers like if I said, hello, what's your favorite color?

  

10:16:36 - Miller Power:

Green.

  

10:16:36 - You:

Yeah, Green.

  

10:16:37 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:16:38 - You:

What's your? I don't know if you watched any, what you favorite movie? Every genre of movie.

  

10:16:43 - Miller Power:

I like comedy films, normally.

  

10:16:46 - You:

Comedy films.

  

10:16:47 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:16:50 - You:

Body parts.

  

10:16:51 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I got a cat.

  

10:16:54 - You:

Yeah, right. So maybe if it was just like, you know, if I had kind of some suggestions like a placeholder, you know, you know what's your favorite color? Favorite genre film. but also,

  

10:17:07 - Miller Power:

Favorite album or someone?

  

10:17:08 - You:

okay. Yeah, what your favorite things?

  

10:17:10 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:17:13 - You:

Have you any weird, weird dislikes, or phobias, you know, that kind of thing? You know, I could stick in that.

  

10:17:19 - Miller Power:

I hate cars, the film.

  

10:17:20 - You:

Hey. Hey, how's the film?

  

10:17:25 - Miller Power:

It makes me uncomfortable.

  

10:17:27 - You:

What are you gonna put on the weekend? Audio asks,

  

10:17:29 - Miller Power:

What do I get up onto the weekend?

  

10:17:30 - You:

if I don't know if they're asking you on a date or what, but

  

10:17:33 - Miller Power:

When I go on a date. Well, I went to your house. And either do work or play video games.

  

10:17:46 - You:

Perhaps mention the fact that you stream on Twitch.

  

10:17:50 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:17:50 - You:

Imagine. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so it's, it's It needs some refinement. I think that's fine. And so used to my different keyboard. Not different key was the same keyboard, but when I'm, when I had to plug it into my workout laptop, the into my workout laptop, the keyboard never the outside and the hash sign

  

10:18:10 - Miller Power:

No.

  

10:18:11 - You:

sort places. So, keep pressing the wrong one.

  

10:18:15 - Miller Power:

You put them back.

  

10:18:16 - You:

Well, no, because I'm just getting more again. It's like 50 50.

  

10:18:19 - Miller Power:

All right.

  

10:18:20 - You:

Things like backsplashes feel like those two anyway. Tell me about what kind of project you work best on.

  

10:18:30 - Miller Power:

um, Such a broad question.

  

10:18:38 - You:

Yeah. There's no rush. I'm mostly doing is just kind of trying to see what kind of things you talk about.

  

10:18:44 - Miller Power:

Yeah. I work better. normally, if I am doing something like this on my own but where I can access support for other people rather than being actively having to tell people and ask people, if I can do things all the time, I, but also, I'm happy to be on a team, but like, if there's like a sense of like, there's a lack of hierarchy, or if like the hierarchy is sort of like, Not the most important thing there. As in. So I can sort of take a dominant stance. in particular things, if I, if I so wish without feeling like I'm like, Breaking the system. I don't want to think I'm gonna get fired for being dominant in a meeting.

  

10:19:38 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:19:41 - Miller Power:

And thinking because I worked really. I the, so, the team for the, the streamy watch on archeology was really good. I worked really well on that team. They were like, Very I don't say forgiving but like very conscious and understanding and sort of listen to how everyone was doing and what like open to everyone's ideas. But also we're happy to like sort of Have socialness in the work atmosphere. Like, we couldn't, we didn't have to like Be formal in the work atmosphere. We could just like go on a side, note about our dog or You know I'd say something funny and we'd have a little bit of a joke for a second rather than just like having to concentrate on the work. It felt like quite relaxed or so like we we were all focused on the goal so I don't know.

  

10:20:32 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:20:33 - Miller Power:

Yeah. It's probably.

  

10:20:44 - You:

Okay. You spoke a lot about the team.

  

10:20:50 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:20:51 - You:

that's, Do you do you have strong opinions on like the work itself and the kind of works kind of work?

  

10:20:58 - Miller Power:

Oh right.

  

10:20:59 - You:

I mean I'm not yeah you didn't do anything wrong. This is this is the next question don't worry.

  

10:21:04 - Miller Power:

Mm-hmm. I don't well I don't know I prefer the work that I already do. It's like hard to say because I just don't sign up for doing things. I don't like but I don't, I'm not regular repetitive tasks or like, doing something that like, I don't say is for no reason but it's like Like I sort of already. It's not teaching me anything, I'm not learning anything. I'm just like, sat there doing a thing and it kind of feels like a waste of my energy. Because I would like to be like, Gaining something from the experience. Even though that's not what work is all the time. um, yeah, I think always I'm like

  

10:22:00 - You:

Hmm.

  

10:22:01 - Miller Power:

reasonably easy but it's like hard to say because I just like haven't been

  

10:22:02 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:22:03 - Miller Power:

I just like I pick my working situations.

  

10:22:06 - You:

Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna start asking you some some of the questions that I've got written down and trying to figure

  

10:22:11 - Miller Power:

Okay.

  

10:22:11 - You:

out, Do you have strong opinions on this? And would you want to know if someone else has to our opinions on this?

  

10:22:18 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:22:21 - You:

First one's probably not that relevant which is I'm more motivated by computer problems than people problems. for archeology problems or whatever. Whatever works.

  

10:22:32 - Miller Power:

So do you mean like I'm more concerned with the work at hand than the people in the office or let the people in my workplace? Or do you mean people problems as in? Like, the way people will receive our work.

  

10:22:46 - You:

so, the thing that had in mind here with in a programming sense is things like Do you care more about? you know, solving really hard, technical problems, where you're not sure if You're not sure if we can figure out how to program it and how to get the algorithms to work versus, how do

  

10:23:08 - Miller Power:

Hmm.

  

10:23:10 - You:

you? How do you are you more interested in? Solving. Problems that people have with relatively simple computer techniques. So for example, I would call manual for me, kind of a people problem. Whereas if your problem was you know, audio, that's very computer problem.

  

10:23:30 - Miller Power:

Yeah. I think I'm more people problem I think I'm more people problem what what Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm more people problem what I add to a team. what I add to a team. Yeah, yeah. I think I'm more people problem I think I'm more people problem either because I generally, that's Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm more people problem either because I generally that's what I add to a team. I haven't often like I'm thinking about just like I just like go to the problem and like we just want to solve the problem. I don't like sticking about

  

10:23:44 - You:

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I thought I was kind of a hard one to be honest, because it's not that

  

10:23:50 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:23:51 - You:

relevant. I can't work on a project. That doesn't excite me. Do you have strong opinions?

  

10:24:00 - Miller Power:

Yeah. Um I wouldn't be like if it was like a bar, I wouldn't be like all the way because I can like persevere with

  

10:24:07 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:24:07 - Miller Power:

like, like they don't have to excite me, but I have to be like, interested, I'm not very good at like, like I was terrible at the courses they made. You do, like you need the modules thing I cared about because like

  

10:24:18 - You:

So, you think, you think it would be more useful if it's that I can't work in a project, it doesn't interest me.

  

10:24:23 - Miller Power:

Yeah, because I'm not really excitable person very often. I feel a bit weird saying, oh, this work excites me. I'm just sort of this is interesting.

  

10:24:31 - You:

Yeah. Okay, so you have relatively strong opinions. And you would want to know if someone else had different opinions, if they were happy to just do something that didn't make interesting.

  

10:24:43 - Miller Power:

Yeah, we'll be useful but then I'd worried I'd take advantage of it. Be like, go do this boring thing?

  

10:24:49 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:24:50 - Miller Power:

But I, I would want people to know that about me for sure. So I'm sure other people would want

  

10:24:53 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:24:54 - Miller Power:

to know it.

  

10:24:55 - You:

Yeah. Would you rather again it's very computer here but would you? I would rather work on one big

  

10:25:00 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:25:02 - You:

feature than lots of small ones or one big publication.

  

10:25:10 - Miller Power:

Mmmm. I think so. It's hard to say because whenever we work on one big thing, it's made up of lots of little things that's just how it is.

  

10:25:17 - You:

Yeah. Yeah.

  

10:25:24 - Miller Power:

I don't. Yeah, I don't this isn't an easily

  

10:25:25 - You:

so, you

  

10:25:26 - Miller Power:

answerable question by me.

  

10:25:28 - You:

Yeah. I think that's but it's hard to kind of take anything from that because it might just be a computer.

  

10:25:42 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I think it might just be a

  

10:25:42 - You:

Yeah, a computer you problem.

  

10:25:43 - Miller Power:

computer thing rather than

  

10:25:46 - You:

My work needs to make a difference in the world.

  

10:25:49 - Miller Power:

yeah.

  

10:25:50 - You:

Is that like strong agree?

  

10:25:52 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:25:54 - You:

You think it's something, is it? Something people need to know about you? Something that you would want to know about someone else if they have different opinions, do you?

  

10:26:00 - Miller Power:

I think I would want to know about other people. Just because then I'd know if I should pick them for projects that I think because like a lot of the archeology work so I like I have done archeology work, but I don't think is like It's just like a bit of fun but like It's just like a bit of fun but like where, like, so the unarcheology where, like, so the unarcheology like particularly important. It's just like a bit of fun but like It's just like a bit of fun but like where, like, so the unarcheology thing, we obviously doing that to like make a point about particularly important. It's just like a bit of fun but like I had no to pick them for things, where, like, so the unarcheology thing, we obviously doing that to like make a point about sort of how Academia works and how we should like make it less, Academia and more everyone can have opinions and s\*\*\*.

  

10:26:30 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:26:31 - Miller Power:

because I care about that problem. It'd be weird if someone or with a team

  

10:26:34 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:26:35 - Miller Power:

team was team was working on didn't care. They were just there to get They were just there to get team was working on that team and didn't care. They were just there to get experience. know. So yeah, I guess I would want to

  

10:26:40 - You:

Okay. Yeah. Awesome. I've been put off projects because of ethical concerns.

  

10:26:50 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:26:51 - You:

And you'd want to know that about other people.

  

10:26:56 - Miller Power:

Yeah. Well Yeah, I just probably wouldn't want to work with someone who wasn't put off. Well, I suppose it's difficult because they might just never been in the situation where there was an ethical problem.

  

10:27:05 - You:

so would it be better if it could be like, you know, I You know I couldn't work on a project that was, you know, ethically spurious something.

  

10:27:16 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:27:17 - You:

You're less ridiculous wording.

  

10:27:19 - Miller Power:

Yeah. like,

  

10:27:24 - You:

Or I couldn't work on a project. I thought,

  

10:27:27 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:27:35 - You:

Cool. I'd rather work on a prototype than the real thing. Or maybe in your case, I'd rather do. like more research and development, type tasks than kind of, it's I don't really know what the parallel is,

  

10:27:57 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:27:58 - You:

If there isn't one and that's fine, we can just move on.

  

10:28:02 - Miller Power:

Mmm.

  

10:28:03 - You:

What I'm trying to get that here is like is it important that you ship something to customers? Or are you happy to just be kind of doing the research and being on the journey and learning?

  

10:28:15 - Miller Power:

and yeah, so I like I get fidgety if we're not actually like Doing the thing. So it's fine.

  

10:28:22 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:28:22 - Miller Power:

If I was knew other people were in charge of knew other people were in charge of knew other people were in charge of doing the thing because I can be on the research team.

  

10:28:26 - You:

Mm-hmm.

  

10:28:28 - Miller Power:

But if I was on the, it was just one

  

10:28:28 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:28:30 - Miller Power:

team and it was all research and doing the thing in one team. I'd be very stressed if we were just

  

10:28:34 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:28:35 - Miller Power:

doing research and not doing the thing, I was like, we're not gonna

  

10:28:38 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:28:38 - Miller Power:

This is a waste of time because we're not going to do anything.

  

10:28:41 - You:

Okay, so that's yeah, I kind of strong disagree. You would rather be doing the real thing, or maybe it's like, it's a great

  

10:28:46 - Miller Power:

Yeah. Yeah, it's like disagree.

  

10:28:50 - You:

something you want to know about the people?

  

10:28:56 - Miller Power:

and yeah, I suppose I'll be useful because what especially If I was like delegating work so far, I've mostly been interested in them

  

10:29:02 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:29:03 - Miller Power:

from a delegation point of view. But

  

10:29:05 - You:

Yeah. And I think that's probably. this section is kind of the project and your your co-workers probably

  

10:29:10 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:29:12 - You:

don't really care. Because, you know, it's not their job to put you on a project.

  

10:29:16 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:29:17 - You:

So this section probably will be very delegating. You can't succeed if you don't finish.

  

10:29:25 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I agree with that.

  

10:29:27 - You:

Okay? You want to know about people. If you know, someone says that they think you can succeed without finishing.

  

10:29:35 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I just wouldn't understand what they meant.

  

10:29:37 - You:

okay, so by that, I think I meant

  

10:29:39 - Miller Power:

um,

  

10:29:40 - You:

that a project can be a success based on the stuff that we kind of learned along the way. even though we didn't achieve the goal,

  

10:29:49 - Miller Power:

oh yeah.

  

10:29:50 - You:

so maybe that is that that's probably worded quite badly, then

  

10:29:55 - Miller Power:

Yeah. I mean, you've just got on an autistic on. I'm not gonna get it if it's like,

  

10:30:01 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:30:03 - Miller Power:

A saying, I don't know.

  

10:30:04 - You:

No, it's pretty fresh. Pretty badly.

  

10:30:06 - Miller Power:

Yeah. and yeah, because I do agree that you can do something and then if we don't do the thing, but I'm generally quite Oriented tutorials. Doing the goal regardless of if it

  

10:30:20 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:30:20 - Miller Power:

goes s\*\*\*. Like if it goes s\*\*\* but we've done

  

10:30:22 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:30:23 - Miller Power:

it. I'm still happy because we learn from it, but if we didn't do it, It doesn't really mean anything to me, I don't know.

  

10:30:29 - You:

Yeah. A project can be successful even though it didn't achieve its goal. Is that still not?

  

10:30:44 - Miller Power:

Project can be successful even if it didn't achieve well and I yeah depends what the goal is. I suppose because like if the goal is to do an event, which is how I'm thinking about it then, I feel like, the success is doing the event

  

10:30:58 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:30:59 - Miller Power:

regardless of how s\*\*\* it went.

  

10:31:01 - You:

yeah, so I think

  

10:31:03 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:31:03 - You:

I I feel like Yeah, I feel kind of hit on something there in that. I would probably say that even if the girl was to do an event and we didn't do the event, the project could still have been a success

  

10:31:17 - Miller Power:

yeah, I mean, I think

  

10:31:19 - You:

You kind of from what you're saying on, imagine of all.

  

10:31:22 - Miller Power:

yeah, like I don't know, I can sort of see that it would depend on the situation, I guess I definitely.

  

10:31:28 - You:

I think I would say, you know, I would see successes like, you know, Maybe I would. Yeah, I probably feel as like this was a success because previously, we clearly didn't know how to get this event. But if we did it again, now we would know how to So I guess overall, I'm happy with how it went because, you know, we've learned we're in a better position now than we were even though we didn't finish the thing.

  

10:31:48 - Miller Power:

yeah, it just to me, it wouldn't feel like we'd finished

  

10:31:52 - You:

Yeah. Yeah, no, that's that's fine. I think that's, that's exactly what it's meant to be questioning. Is that we're different in that sense.

  

10:31:59 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:32:05 - You:

I'm really not sure what the parallel of this is going to be, but users generally know what the main problems are.

  

10:32:10 - Miller Power:

No, they don't.

  

10:32:12 - You:

Okay. I think that's that's fine. Would you want to know if someone thought that they did?

  

10:32:18 - Miller Power:

I'd be interested in them.

  

10:32:20 - You:

Okay. Well hello. I think that users generally know

  

10:32:21 - Miller Power:

As.

  

10:32:22 - You:

what the problems are.

  

10:32:24 - Miller Power:

That's fair.

  

10:32:26 - You:

They don't know, they don't know how

  

10:32:27 - Miller Power:

I mean like oh it depends what the

  

10:32:27 - You:

to fix it.

  

10:32:28 - Miller Power:

thing is.

  

10:32:30 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:32:30 - Miller Power:

like, Yeah, I don't I don't really mean the right. So the reason I loved is because so I can't tell you where Dan works because it's a secret. But at Dan's work, it's a

  

10:32:40 - You:

Okay.

  

10:32:42 - Miller Power:

service job and the people.

  

10:32:43 - You:

Right. Yeah.

  

10:32:44 - Miller Power:

people come up with Solutions.

  

10:32:47 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:32:48 - Miller Power:

That aren't thinking about how I like to say players are dumb. so, the players of the customer service situation, Are not just gonna know what you were thinking even though if you think you've really made it obvious, you've got to make it like so obvious. So that's why I said that but really, yeah, I think you should ask users what they think the problems are As I was more thinking about players are done, but I yeah.

  

10:33:09 - You:

I think I get what you mean. Yeah, I think yeah, my perspect on

  

10:33:10 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:33:12 - You:

that is Users as a group in aggregate know what the problems are but don't know what the solutions are. Individual terminal for conclude.

  

10:33:24 - Miller Power:

I would agree with that.

  

10:33:24 - You:

So, this is really this needs to be rephrased. Yeah. Okay. I need to know how things work under the hood.

  

10:33:36 - Miller Power:

And not necessarily.

  

10:33:38 - You:

Would you want to know if someone did

  

10:33:38 - Miller Power:

It depends what it is.

  

10:33:40 - You:

if someone did need to know that?

  

10:33:41 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah. Well, that would be important because I would take time to explain it to them if I could.

  

10:33:47 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:33:48 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:33:50 - You:

I'm wondering, if maybe that should be on a different category then because so far, all of these have kind of been like things that matter you would need to know to delegate work. And that one feels like

  

10:34:00 - Miller Power:

Yeah, whereas I'd want to know that on a personal level.

  

10:34:06 - You:

Cool. I work best on predictable projects where we can safely say where we'll be in a month's time.

  

10:34:14 - Miller Power:

Oh, Well, this is a difficult one because on the one hand, I like to have like a Clear Vision of what we're trying to to do and like the progress. I I hate it when we're sort of, in we've had five meetings this month and like we're still like not sure what we're gonna be a Clear Vision of what we're trying to do and like the progress. I I hate it when we're sort of in we've had five meetings this month and like we're still like not sure what we're going to be doing next month and like stuff like that but additionally, I am very Pro postponing. Like, if it looks like, we're not going to achieve the thing. Or it's gonna like be harmful to us to try and achieve the thing. I'm very Pro saying well let's change the schedule and try and achieve it

  

10:34:54 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:34:55 - Miller Power:

in three months. But I like that being a schedule to an extent.

  

10:35:01 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:35:01 - Miller Power:

one like today, you must achieve the these three things were like this week. Can we just get this sword?

  

10:35:08 - You:

so, it's kind of what am I trying to get up? It's You think of other jobs, it's almost like a construction project versus being a firefighter.

  

10:35:21 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:35:22 - You:

Which one do you? Lean more towards? Where the, you know, firefighters, you know, you're setting there and then suddenly it's going to go. Something random is happening. You've got a reaction improvise versus construction where you kind of know what's gonna be happening. When

  

10:35:37 - Miller Power:

I see, but I'm good at improvising and I, I like improvising. I'm not like a big, it's difficult.

  

10:35:45 - You:

You kind of need to balance. You know.

  

10:35:46 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:35:47 - You:

it can be very kind of exhausting and a kind of improvised and crisis situation,

  

10:35:53 - Miller Power:

yeah, like I have I like to have like a broad overview of like where we're going like again if we bring up like the event or like the final product,

  

10:36:00 - You:

Mm-hmm.

  

10:36:01 - Miller Power:

we want to get the final product done by next March. So we need to like have done all the customer research by the end of August. and then we need to be like, by

  

10:36:15 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:36:16 - Miller Power:

end of December, we want to know who's going to be producing the project or where the the practicalities of the thing.

  

10:36:23 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:36:23 - Miller Power:

So we can start advertising it before, March?

  

10:36:26 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:36:28 - Miller Power:

but I don't, I don't need there to be like a really like It. I like also I don't mind when like things just come up and you're like oh this is interrupted the thing. I'm like all right, we'll go do that quickly and then we'll come back to the broader plan because the broad plan is so broad that you can come back and it'll be fine.

  

10:36:46 - You:

Cool. It's better to take risks and then clean up the mess than to go slow and mess on opportunity.

  

10:36:54 - Miller Power:

It. Oh I remember you saying the sale day and I was like oh oh,

  

10:37:00 - You:

That's in. Well, it's divisive.

  

10:37:03 - Miller Power:

yeah, like I I'm not sure which I would say

  

10:37:06 - You:

Right.

  

10:37:06 - Miller Power:

because my initial reaction was to go slow, but also, I'm not like that

  

10:37:10 - You:

Mmm.

  

10:37:10 - Miller Power:

But also I'm not like that because I'm very goal oriented and I want to just do the thing and I think sometimes people are like we need to think about like yeah, like I've been on teams where people are like, oh, but is this specific wording of this specific sentence? Okay. And I'm like, who cares? like we skimmed it, to make sure it's not like offensive like we've done our best like

  

10:37:30 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:37:30 - Miller Power:

I think people could be too risk-averse. Yeah, so I'm probably closer to the

  

10:37:36 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:37:38 - Miller Power:

So I'm probably closer to the take risks and clean up later but I'm not like super like that because I like to at least check things over before we put them out. And

  

10:37:46 - You:

That's something I maybe haven't mentioned is one of the questions I don't have is. You know, it's better to be late than bad.

  

10:37:57 - Miller Power:

Mmm. Yeah.

  

10:38:01 - You:

And is that, would you rather be bad or late?

  

10:38:05 - Miller Power:

Late. But that's because yeah, I think I think I would agree with it even if I was like making a product rather than an event.

  

10:38:17 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:38:18 - Miller Power:

Because well, it depends how bad the events gonna be like.

  

10:38:21 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:38:22 - Miller Power:

like you've got to like do an assessment but generally I'd rather put something out that was helpful or Like, not again, it's about like harming the organizers as well. I'm very into like having healthy working practices. So if it's gonna be harmful or like too much stress to do it, I would rather be late.

  

10:38:40 - You:

Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, those are all the questions about projects. I think there's some useful stuff there, even though a lot of it wasn't too relevant.

  

10:38:50 - Miller Power:

Yes, Souls.

  

10:38:50 - You:

I've realized this is probably going to take a long time.

  

10:38:53 - Miller Power:

That's fine.

  

10:38:53 - You:

Okay, because we're like one section

  

10:38:55 - Miller Power:

I'll tell you if I need a way.

  

10:38:55 - You:

in. Yeah absolutely. Like feel free to go take breaks or whatever.

  

10:38:59 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:39:02 - You:

Yeah. Okay, so it's gonna be more questions about the teams which you kind of already talked about. I work best when I'm told what to do in detail.

  

10:39:17 - Miller Power:

Um yeah, again it really depends what it is. I think this can be relevant to programming as well, because like I so if I know if I'm, I don't say an expert, but it's like my thing. That I don't need detailed

  

10:39:30 - You:

Mm-hmm.

  

10:39:31 - Miller Power:

instructions. I'd rather like Vibe at myself. But if it's like I work in a pub.

  

10:39:37 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:39:37 - Miller Power:

and I feel like they're just like, Tap The Keg, and I'm like, What does that mean?

  

10:39:42 - You:

Yeah. Yeah.

  

10:39:43 - Miller Power:

You need to tell me every single tiny instruction and tapping the cake.

  

10:39:47 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:39:47 - Miller Power:

Yeah, so it depends if it's something that I already know how to do. I get very frustrated that someone's telling me how to do it. I'll be like, f\*\*\* off. um, I obviously know how to do that, but yeah, if it's something I'm not an expert in, then I would definitely

  

10:39:59 - You:

Okay.

  

10:40:00 - Miller Power:

want to be told how to do exercise. I will be stressed

  

10:40:04 - You:

Cool. Thank you. That's really helpful.

  

10:40:15 - You:

And that's something that you would want to know about other people. I assume

  

10:40:18 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:40:19 - You:

Because, yeah, okay.

  

10:40:20 - Miller Power:

because I'd want to explain it to the people if they need to explaining But also, I don't want to piss people off by, you know, put patronizing

  

10:40:25 - You:

Yeah. Yeah.

  

10:40:27 - Miller Power:

them by accident.

  

10:40:29 - You:

I enjoyed technical debates or I guess I enjoy theoretical debates.

  

10:40:36 - Miller Power:

Um, no.

  

10:40:38 - You:

Okay. Something you'd want to know about other people.

  

10:40:42 - Miller Power:

And yeah, I guess. Well like well I mean also, it

  

10:40:44 - You:

Most, I guess.

  

10:40:45 - Miller Power:

depends.

  

10:40:45 - You:

So Basically, Basically all of these are you would want to know if someone was different to you because The goal. This is that we're just not going to show you in a few of the same because you don't need to know.

  

10:40:55 - Miller Power:

No. Yeah.

  

10:40:57 - You:

So yeah.

  

10:40:59 - Miller Power:

yeah, I guess I would want to know if someone because like, if I was starting to get into a debate with them because like I don't mind a theoretical, it depends what you mean. Because depends like everyone has a different version of what theoretical is. But I hate things like oh what if we all see colors different because like, f\*\*\* off.

  

10:41:17 - You:

Right. I think theoretical technical debates in this sense of things like we need to achieve this. There are four different ways to do

  

10:41:24 - Miller Power:

Mmm.

  

10:41:24 - You:

it. Let's kind of sit here and debate all the pros and cons and kind of conclusion about which ones, right?

  

10:41:34 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I think I'd, I'd have less patience for it than other people because I think other people, they just like, go around in circles. Whereas I really notice, once, once we've said something, it's just I've

  

10:41:43 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:41:44 - Miller Power:

know that we've said it, I don't want to say it again.

  

10:41:46 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:41:47 - Miller Power:

So like yeah. So like yeah. Still a bit. No, but not like like, super, no. I don't want to say it again. So like yeah. Still a bit. No, but not like like, super, no. He's like, I do think we need to debate and discuss and have everyone's ideas come out.

  

10:41:55 - You:

Cool, social events helped me feel part of a team. It's about I mean, like purely social events.

  

10:42:02 - Miller Power:

Yeah. like, I don't need them all the time,

  

10:42:04 - You:

and I get,

  

10:42:05 - Miller Power:

but like it's nice to just

  

10:42:06 - You:

but it's something that you would want.

  

10:42:08 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:42:09 - You:

I appreciate when people reach out and offer support spontaneously.

  

10:42:20 - Miller Power:

this is very similar to the Do I want instructions or not question?

  

10:42:26 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:42:27 - Miller Power:

In that it could feel patronizing or it could feel helpful depending on if I was struggling with the thing or not, because I'm not great to

  

10:42:32 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:42:32 - Miller Power:

for help.

  

10:42:34 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:42:35 - Miller Power:

So I guess yes but sometimes it might piss me off. If I'm doing fine but I suppose

  

10:42:38 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:42:40 - Miller Power:

that's my own problem. I just

  

10:42:43 - You:

Is there a better way that you could phrase it? where, I guess. Do you think that anyone would be strongly agree or strongly disagree with those? when people reach out and offer support spontaneously.

  

10:42:57 - Miller Power:

I think people could be strongly agree because they just like that. People don't know it thinking about them and like just checking in

  

10:43:04 - You:

Yeah. and I guess people, you could be strongly disagree on the basis of I would ask

  

10:43:10 - Miller Power:

Yeah, exactly. Because I mean yeah it depends on the

  

10:43:12 - You:

Okay.

  

10:43:13 - Miller Power:

situation as well because it was like a manager whose job was to come and check in on me. I wouldn't bother me. Because that's their job.

  

10:43:18 - You:

Yeah. Yeah.

  

10:43:20 - Miller Power:

But if it was like a colleague just being like, Oh, you're right. Mate, I be like, yes.

  

10:43:25 - You:

Okay, cool. So, I've got a question here, which kind of comes back. Something you said, which is I prefer when there was a clear hierarchy under defined roles Does that feel like it's two

  

10:43:39 - Miller Power:

Mmm.

  

10:43:39 - You:

questions to you? What does it feel like one? Does it feel like if you

  

10:43:43 - Miller Power:

Where when did that come up before? Because I remember, it coming up before.

  

10:43:46 - You:

so, it's towards the start of this interview, you said, Happy to be on a team of the subtle or no hierarchy, so I can take a feeling like I'm breaking the system.

  

10:43:57 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I think that's because you more broadly asked me like, what work I like to do. I think I was probably just answering

  

10:44:02 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:44:03 - Miller Power:

the question weirdly

  

10:44:04 - You:

No, yeah, no, no, that's that's not a problem. I'm more saying, you know, you said

  

10:44:08 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:44:09 - You:

that, you said that you weren't a fan of kind of strict hierarchies. but is the question actually

  

10:44:13 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:44:14 - You:

addressing that or is the is the fact that I talk about defined roles as well a problem.

  

10:44:18 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah, so I do like defined roles as long as they're not like really strict and you don't feel like hammered into it.

  

10:44:26 - You:

Okay, so it should be two questions.

  

10:44:27 - Miller Power:

like, Yeah.

  

10:44:34 - You:

Image.

  

10:44:37 - Miller Power:

Hi, Mitch.

  

10:44:39 - You:

I prefer when there is established structure and processes.

  

10:44:48 - Miller Power:

Can we already do this? That was more about like a of root like not a routine, I like Time structure.

  

10:45:01 - You:

So we talked about predictable projects where we can safely say or we'll be in a month's time.

  

10:45:06 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:45:08 - You:

and this is more talking about, So like your day-to-day, you know, kind of thing of. So I guess in it's Maybe not maybe doesn't have parallels in Academia in archeology. So in software, we often have like software development processes where, where, you know, you'd have a meeting every two weeks or by processes, maybe it's, you know, when you have this issue, this is who you raise it to always and kind of where, you know, you'd have a meeting every two weeks or by processes, maybe it's, you know, when you have this issue, this is who you raise it to always and kind of that kind of structure and process as opposed to. It's a bit of a free for all you talk to whoever you want.

  

10:45:35 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah, I like a bit of that like again, I don't like it to be like super strict as if I if I decide actually. I think it's better if I talk to this first and I want to be able to make my own decision autonomously, but I'd autonomously, but I'd like the

  

10:45:45 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:45:46 - Miller Power:

guidelines are helpful.

  

10:45:48 - You:

Yeah. Okay, cool. I end up talking to everyone on the team even though we don't really work together.

  

10:45:58 - Miller Power:

Hmm. No I'm not very good at like, making the rounds.

  

10:46:02 - You:

Would you want to know if someone was, you know, strongly agree with that.

  

10:46:06 - Miller Power:

um, I guess but I probably just noticed.

  

10:46:10 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:46:13 - Miller Power:

It wouldn't make that much difference for me, but I could see it making difference to other people who might be like, why are you talking to me? Whereas I'd, I'd sort of know why

  

10:46:17 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:46:18 - Miller Power:

were talking to me, because they're just, I can just tell that that someone who likes to socialize. Hang on, I gotta go get like a blanket. It's cold in my office.

  

10:46:28 - You:

No worries. I'm doing pretty good much. Yeah, I'm yeah, I'm kind of enjoying this enjoying going through these questions and Cleaning them up a bit starting to get something a bit more together. The world Middle School. I'm gonna fix my website.

  

10:47:01 - Miller Power:

Blankets achieve.

  

10:47:03 - You:

Awesome. Oh no.

  

10:47:09 - Miller Power:

What?

  

10:47:09 - You:

Sorry, bear with me. I'm just I'm just busy fixing my website while you were

  

10:47:13 - Miller Power:

All right. Yeah. He sent me a kitten.

  

10:47:14 - You:

There it is.

  

10:47:14 - Miller Power:

What me? Or Steven. Steven didn't send me.

  

10:47:20 - You:

Oh, it's a kitten. It's a handy puzzle. Cute. Sorry, you want second.

  

10:47:36 - Miller Power:

Oh, yes, kitten. Nice.

  

10:47:52 - You:

Hey. So the next question was, I tend to get wrapped up in team politics.

  

10:47:59 - Miller Power:

oh, I don't like getting wrapped up until politics. but sometimes I do because I'm Sometimes the best person to sort it out because I'm good at working with people by, hey it

  

10:48:21 - You:

Okay, would it be more useful as a question? If asked, if you enjoy getting enjoy the politicals that you enjoy.

  

10:48:33 - Miller Power:

Or like, um, like fine with it because I know if you enjoy it, then that's a bit weird.

  

10:48:37 - You:

Well, that's the question.

  

10:48:37 - Miller Power:

I don't know.

  

10:48:38 - You:

Let's points that you can. There'll be a slighting scale?

  

10:48:40 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:48:43 - You:

Okay, so it's like I enjoy. I enjoy team politics.

  

10:48:48 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I just be, I would be south of anyone who enjoys team politics because it's always a bit gossipy and but I don't know, maybe that's just me.

  

10:48:57 - You:

I think everyone would be but then like, Maybe it's just like I try to avoid team politics.

  

10:49:03 - Miller Power:

That might be better. Yeah.

  

10:49:10 - You:

Okay. Workers, work. My colleagues aren't my friends.

  

10:49:15 - Miller Power:

Um, I agree with that to some extent but also I don't know. I'm happy for my work colleagues. To be my friends. They just don't need to be my friends.

  

10:49:23 - You:

So should it be like? I try to keep my work life and social life separate something like that.

  

10:49:28 - Miller Power:

Yeah, because I don't particularly try but I am fine if they are.

  

10:49:51 - You:

oh, I tend to be quite formal and serious at work.

  

10:49:58 - Miller Power:

No.

  

10:50:01 - You:

Yeah, would you want to know if someone said yes?

  

10:50:03 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:50:04 - You:

Yeah, cool. And the team should look out for each other and have a sense of camaraderie.

  

10:50:10 - Miller Power:

And I think that makes it better. Yeah.

  

10:50:14 - You:

And you'd want to know if you want to know. Someone said no.

  

10:50:17 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

  

10:50:19 - You:

Cool. I should feel a sense of belonging in my team.

  

10:50:25 - Miller Power:

Um, yeah, not like like really intensely. But yeah, I want to feel like I've sort of a good piece to the puzzle and I'm supposed to be there.

  

10:50:40 - You:

Yeah. Okay, and that feels distinct from

  

10:50:41 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:50:43 - You:

the last question to you. About camaraderie. It's that that question's more like to you. It's more asking about kind of your role in the team and how

  

10:50:54 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I I would say that they are

  

10:50:54 - You:

you Okay.

  

10:50:55 - Miller Power:

different questions. They are, they similar but they're different.

  

10:51:04 - You:

Cool. You should be loyal to your team.

  

10:51:10 - Miller Power:

No. But don't tell anyone.

  

10:51:17 - You:

So you wouldn't be comfortable telling the truth about that question.

  

10:51:21 - Miller Power:

No.

  

10:51:22 - You:

Okay, thank you.

  

10:51:22 - Miller Power:

Because I don't want people to think

  

10:51:22 - You:

That's

  

10:51:23 - Miller Power:

I'm a b\*\*\*\*, but obviously if I don't

  

10:51:25 - You:

I mean, I'd I'd probably say strongly disagree. Don't worry.

  

10:51:28 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I know, but I think you're fine with being a b\*\*\*\*.

  

10:51:30 - You:

Yeah, that's true.

  

10:51:41 - You:

Once that strongly agreed to that. We, what would would you want to know? Would that be relevant?

  

10:51:48 - Miller Power:

I yeah, I'd probably be useful in my old brain bank because then I wouldn't. like, I definitely wouldn't tell them that I might not always be on their side if I don't agree with them. I don't know.

  

10:52:01 - You:

Yeah, yeah, that's a tricky one.

  

10:52:03 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:52:06 - You:

um, I don't keep any secrets from my team and I expect them to be open with me too. I hate that question.

  

10:52:12 - Miller Power:

That's a bizarre question.

  

10:52:13 - You:

But It's I know that's like something you're asking about you f\*\*\*\*\*\* partner. I'm moment in terms of like, transparency at work and like You know, do I is it? what I'm trying to get out is like yeah, in terms of like work and what you're doing are you naturally kind of transparent and open about it and sharing it with people versus kind of I'm gonna need to know basis.

  

10:52:40 - Miller Power:

Right? So if we have like a meeting all the time, I'll obviously like give a recap of what I've done. And that won't be a secret but I'm not like someone who goes around saying, oh, I did this. Now I've done this. I'll just like so often people just go to do something like I already f\*\*\*\*\*\* did it.

  

10:52:57 - You:

Yeah, what I'm trying to get up is when you will often have it's often a thing with managers to be honest is like

  

10:53:06 - Miller Power:

Hmm.

  

10:53:07 - You:

where there'll be some change, coming on the horizon, and they just won't tell anyone until it's kind of ready and kind of finished and kind of all sorted as opposed to kind of being open at the earlier stages and trying to get that kind of input from the team.

  

10:53:23 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah, I'm definitely the latter. I would You know, because I, I've been the worker. That's not been told about the change

  

10:53:31 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:53:31 - Miller Power:

and it's annoying. So I would try and inform people.

  

10:53:32 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:53:35 - Miller Power:

As long as if it was like a more of a private matter. Like, you know, someone's getting fired. then I'm not gonna say one of you is gonna be made redundant like really

  

10:53:42 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:53:44 - Miller Power:

early on

  

10:53:45 - You:

You are the weakest link?

  

10:53:46 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:53:49 - You:

Cool. The next question is my team's success. My Success is the team's success and vice versa.

  

10:53:59 - Miller Power:

I don't really know what you mean.

  

10:54:01 - You:

So I'm trying to assess kind of collectivism versus individualism on the team and whether you care about kind of individual status or whether you want the team as a whole. Succeed. Does that make sense?

  

10:54:21 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:54:21 - You:

The basically like, you know, if I do some really good work, Am I happy that? I did some really good work and I want everyone to notice or am I happy that the project is now in a better place and the team will get praise for that.

  

10:54:36 - Miller Power:

Yeah I think I'm probably more of the latter. Again I'm ultimately trying to make the project be better but I also appreciate when I am when people notice that my particular input and like the amount of input I put in Especially if I put Lots in.

  

10:54:51 - You:

Yeah. So yeah, you kind of a little bit medley.

  

10:54:57 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

10:54:59 - You:

Cool. Oh my God. That was a very Squeaky.

  

10:55:01 - Miller Power:

Hi baby.

  

10:55:02 - You:

Hello. She's off. And then the next question is kind of similar actually. I need my contributions to be recognized.

  

10:55:09 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I do like them to recognize, I don't need them to be because I don't expect them to be but I definitely feel more comfortable when they are.

  

10:55:18 - You:

Does that feel like a duplicate of Alaska question?

  

10:55:21 - Miller Power:

No.

  

10:55:28 - You:

okay, I guess if someone said That they are very kind of individualist in that last question. And I guess they could say they don't need the contributions to be recognized, but they just don't they don't feel like it's the team's success, it's their success.

  

10:55:42 - Miller Power:

Yeah, because I feel like the previous question. You could say your individualistic and really, you're just thinking about what this you're getting out of this and what you've achieved.

  

10:55:52 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:55:52 - Miller Power:

and not really what the team achieve but you don't need people to tell you that you've achieved because, you know, you have

  

10:55:58 - You:

Okay, cool. That is then. That is the that's the my team section.

  

10:56:03 - Miller Power:

Dank.

  

10:56:05 - You:

So, the next one is about your work and your day today.

  

10:56:09 - Miller Power:

Mm-hmm.

  

10:56:12 - You:

So, I'm better at starting projects than finishing them. Or starting things and finishing them.

  

10:56:18 - Miller Power:

And I think everyone's better at starting things and finishing them because the starting is at the bit at the beginning, that always happens. I don't know.

  

10:56:26 - You:

On our work project, you can join halfway through.

  

10:56:29 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah, I guess. um, I'm fine with drawing halfway through, I do like starting the thing, but also, I'm not forwarded. like,

  

10:56:42 - You:

Does it feel relevant? Like, would you want to know that about someone else? Like me, me, personally, I am significantly better at starting things than finishing them. like, Probably a good 75% of my projects having got finished.

  

10:56:59 - Miller Power:

Yeah. I just thought that was true of everyone. Because I'm also like that.

  

10:57:06 - You:

So, some people much prefer finishing things.

  

10:57:10 - Miller Power:

Yeah. Okay.

  

10:57:11 - You:

and you know, would rather kind of, you know, dot the eyes cross, the t's, Get it out the door. rather than having kind of a thousand different options to start a project, and a lot of uncertainty,

  

10:57:25 - Miller Power:

Oh, I like like shaping. What? It's gonna be. But then I also wanted to be finished. Preferably, I just don't sometimes

  

10:57:34 - You:

okay, so that I think,

  

10:57:35 - Miller Power:

Um, yeah, because I don't know because the sorry.

  

10:57:38 - You:

I've never gone.

  

10:57:38 - Miller Power:

Because the way you phrased, it is like, would you be happy coming in to a team halfway through and now I think about it. I I Don't mind as long as I know what all the context is. I don't like coming in, like quite late because I just feel like I don't know what's going on.

  

10:57:52 - You:

Mm-hmm.

  

10:57:52 - Miller Power:

And people are terrible at feeling you in even if they thought they have filled you in. So, yeah, I guess I do

  

10:57:56 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:57:57 - Miller Power:

prefer starting things, but like, I don't, I wouldn't want it to reflect that. I don't like finishing things because I prefer things are finished. It makes me stressed that I have loads of projects that I've never finished. But like, I don't, I don't want it to reflect that, I don't like finishing things because I prefer things are finished. It makes me stressed that I have loads of projects that I've never finished.

  

10:58:07 - You:

Yeah. Okay, cool. I'm more of a specialist in generalist.

  

10:58:18 - Miller Power:

No.

  

10:58:21 - You:

See you to say you're done, you're a generalist.

  

10:58:27 - Miller Power:

Yeah, obviously I have like some Specialists but I'm not as much of a specialist as lots of people. I'm

  

10:58:31 - You:

You're a tea person.

  

10:58:33 - Miller Power:

yeah, I'm a bit of a T post but I'm more of the, the team and the The pose.

  

10:58:38 - You:

The person I get what you mean. Yeah, you're you're white tea.

  

10:58:45 - Miller Power:

I'm a wide t.

  

10:58:46 - You:

Yeah. And you'd want to know if someone was was a lowercase L person.

  

10:58:55 - Miller Power:

Uh,

  

10:58:58 - You:

As if someone was very specialist.

  

10:58:58 - Miller Power:

Lower case, l. Oh right. Yes, to me. A lowercase. I was like is all got a tail. Yeah, I know me now.

  

10:59:07 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:59:08 - Miller Power:

Um, yeah, I guess so, but I'd want to

  

10:59:09 - You:

I work with computers.

  

10:59:10 - Miller Power:

know what they were specialist in. I don't know.

  

10:59:13 - You:

Yeah.

  

10:59:14 - Miller Power:

I know I'm more interested if someone is Broad but I'm broad so I don't you've got it covered with the broad.

  

10:59:22 - You:

Yeah. so, it's probably the kind of thing that would want to go in the iceberg section is To cover those.

  

10:59:29 - Miller Power:

Yeah, like what your specialism is,

  

10:59:30 - You:

Kind of domains. Yeah.

  

10:59:31 - Miller Power:

yeah.

  

10:59:31 - You:

What Okay. I've scrolled way too farther.

  

10:59:39 - Miller Power:

Ops.

  

10:59:41 - You:

I need a plan before I'm comfortable starting.

  

10:59:44 - Miller Power:

No, I'm happy making the plan. I would like there to eventually be one but I don't need there to be one

  

10:59:49 - You:

So that, no, that's okay.

  

10:59:49 - Miller Power:

when I get there.

  

10:59:51 - You:

No, that's okay. So you do need a plan, you're just gonna make it yourself. That needs rephrase, like, doesn't it? Because it's I wouldn't start it's more of I wouldn't start if there wasn't a plan, I wouldn't act. I wouldn't like I don't act until it's a plan.

  

11:00:06 - Miller Power:

Yeah, but I feel like often stage one with a if you're working with people is making the plan,

  

11:00:13 - You:

Yeah, but I would I would be more than happy to start with that having a plan.

  

11:00:16 - Miller Power:

what would you do?

  

11:00:18 - You:

I just I kind of wander around and look for things to be doing and do them.

  

11:00:23 - Miller Power:

But how do you know what needs to do it?

  

11:00:25 - You:

Because you look at it, it's a bit s\*\*\*.

  

11:00:28 - Miller Power:

You know, we've not made anything

  

11:00:28 - You:

It's like yesterday.

  

11:00:29 - Miller Power:

yet.

  

11:00:32 - You:

Well, yeah. I mean I don't I don't really have a plan with manual for me. I'm just wondering about doing things

  

11:00:39 - Miller Power:

Well yeah but you must have some kind of planks you were like alright this is the idea.

  

11:00:43 - You:

Yeah, it was one sentence.

  

11:00:45 - Miller Power:

yeah, that's that's the

  

11:00:46 - You:

That's not a plan.

  

11:00:47 - Miller Power:

that's the starting point and then you were like, well what's the next thing I have to do?

  

11:00:52 - You:

And then I did it.

  

11:00:53 - Miller Power:

And then you did it.

  

11:00:53 - You:

But But I know I But I know I never planned more than one step ahead.

  

11:01:00 - Miller Power:

You can't see my face. I'm pulling a face. I'm thinking

  

11:01:03 - You:

Okay, so it sounds like we're quite different there.

  

11:01:06 - Miller Power:

Yeah, but I don't like, I don't know. I like to know what I'm doing next.

  

11:01:11 - You:

Well yeah.

  

11:01:12 - Miller Power:

But what I'm currently doing? I don't like to be, just be like, okay, here's the room. The room has 20 things in it. And they're all of differing priorities, but we're not going to tell you. I like to have an idea of what the priority of everything is, but I don't need to be told which one to do next, as long as I can work out for myself.

  

11:01:32 - You:

I would be most happy if you just like, gave me a website and a code base and said like just wander around it and look for things you need fixing and fix them.

  

11:01:41 - Miller Power:

to waste my time if you already know what the things that need fixing up,

  

11:01:45 - You:

Well, no, no because they don't.

  

11:01:47 - Miller Power:

Alright, okay.

  

11:01:47 - You:

If that is a plan, I'd rather be giving us. But like I wouldn't say, I wouldn't sit down and look at the website and break down things that I was gonna fix and then fix it. I just wander around, fix them as I saw them.

  

11:01:57 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah, I'd naturally start doing that and then I'd realize that I am way behind schedule and then I probably make a plan to make sure I got it done.

  

11:02:04 - You:

Yeah, I don't, I don't work very well

  

11:02:05 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:02:07 - You:

with schedules.

  

11:02:09 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I I don't but then I realize I have to. So Because otherwise I'll put way too much time in one thing. Like, I can't tell when something's

  

11:02:21 - You:

Yeah, I'd be that.

  

11:02:22 - Miller Power:

finished. If there's not a time to say that, it's finished.

  

11:02:26 - You:

Yeah. I yeah, I welcome to my degree. That was, that was on my coursework was like, so I went around, see what I feel like doing work on that, until I'm happy with it. Move on. Oh, what this one's now? We played. Oh well,

  

11:02:38 - Miller Power:

Yeah, because I've never happy with it. So there has to be a time when it's time to stop.

  

11:02:43 - You:

Okay, next question is, I'm most productive during a crisis.

  

11:02:51 - Miller Power:

Stupid f\*\*\*\*\*\* question. Like, I understand. Because like I do get more done if there's like a time pressure but also like it's not my best work. I'd rather than not like I want to

  

11:03:04 - You:

Okay, I'm gonna change it.

  

11:03:05 - Miller Power:

know when it's

  

11:03:06 - You:

Then Then I did my best work during a

  

11:03:06 - Miller Power:

yeah.

  

11:03:07 - You:

crisis.

  

11:03:11 - Miller Power:

What's the same question, isn't it?

  

11:03:14 - You:

Obama's about predict. One was about productivity. One was about best work. My productivity to me is more about most work. Of the best work.

  

11:03:21 - Miller Power:

Yeah. Yeah. I don't know, I'd still struggle. I would I would say no but I just don't think they should, like, I don't know. People shouldn't need to be stressed to do things. understanding how some people work. I don't know.

  

11:03:40 - You:

Okay. So the reason that I've changed already is because I am a strongly agree with this. And I'm trying to think of what would like. I'm trying to phrase it in the most extreme way. Well, I would still strongly agree and you would then strongly disagree so that we get the kind of the broadest range.

  

11:03:55 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:03:56 - You:

Like I'm I'm most happy when there is, you know, all Hands-On decks. The servers are on fire like we need to fix things that kind of battle

  

11:04:05 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:04:06 - You:

station situation is what I work best.

  

11:04:11 - Miller Power:

see, but I don't think

  

11:04:12 - You:

And it doesn't really stress me out. Which is probably the weirdest thing.

  

11:04:16 - Miller Power:

yeah, well I'm sort of the same but also I Like it isn't actively stressed me out, but like afterwards. I'll feel like very dumb. You know, I'm very, I'm good at like, when it's like the crunch. But I know it's like bad for me.

  

11:04:29 - You:

Yeah. Yeah.

  

11:04:32 - Miller Power:

Like, but I wouldn't want to advertise that. I'm good at the crunch because I don't want to be like, I know the crunch is bad for me. Even though I'm good at it.

  

11:04:44 - You:

Okay. Trying to figure out what the, what the difference between us is in the sense.

  

11:04:52 - Miller Power:

Well, do you find it to be bad for you or is it just fine?

  

11:04:59 - You:

it's I'm not sure, it depends. I can come out, I can go, we need to put. Yeah, it depends on. As long as I'm working like the same hours, I'm fine. If there's more pressure, that doesn't really stress me out, if anything, it probably energizes me more. in the You know, I get my kind of energy from fixing things and making improvements and when there's a crisis, all of the barriers to making those improvements, go away. And I can do my work.

  

11:05:31 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I feel up. so, I was imagining my ideal workplaces where It's always. I just get on with it.

  

11:05:42 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:05:43 - Miller Power:

It always has that aspect of the crunch.

  

11:05:45 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:05:46 - Miller Power:

Um yeah, I totally agree with that. I do prefer if I can just like it's

  

11:05:51 - You:

Okay.

  

11:05:52 - Miller Power:

time, let's do it. But if there's not enough time like I

  

11:05:54 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:05:55 - Miller Power:

because I'm really thinking of times where there's not enough time to do everything, so it's very difficult.

  

11:06:01 - You:

Yeah, we don't really. We don't really have that in software.

  

11:06:05 - Miller Power:

That's all Academia is.

  

11:06:08 - You:

We if there's not enough time we are late or we reduced the number of features and tell us enough time and you don't get to complain about it because it's your fault for scheduling in too much.

  

11:06:18 - Miller Power:

Yeah, no, that doesn't happen.

  

11:06:21 - You:

Yeah. We received the power. Okay.

  

11:06:27 - Miller Power:

yeah, so when you say a crisis I'm thinking there's not enough time

  

11:06:33 - You:

Okay, so to me, that's a great when I say Christ or something more kind of you know like we are under attack. Someone's actively attacking our service. And if we don't do anything, it's gonna come crashing down and cost the company five million dollars. That's why I'm thinking over the crisis, or like,

  

11:06:51 - Miller Power:

I mean, that sounds that sounds fun. As long as I'm not gonna get fired at the end, I'd be stressed. If if it went wrong that's the end of my job and now I'm poor but I wouldn't be stressed if we were just

  

11:07:00 - You:

That's true.

  

11:07:00 - Miller Power:

doing it.

  

11:07:02 - You:

I've never really been concerned with job, job security.

  

11:07:06 - Miller Power:

Oh well, it's nice to summon it.

  

11:07:08 - You:

I know, imagine what's a working Tech it's just f\*\*\*\*\*\* it's like playing life with you with cheat codes. Okay. Refresh doing more about energized. Plus one of the crisis, Hey.

  

11:07:25 - Miller Power:

Yeah, because I'd love a lot. That's like that because you don't get fired from alarm.

  

11:07:30 - You:

I know, but in Tech if you get fired, you can get another job in like a week.

  

11:07:34 - Miller Power:

Where's your job, then?

  

11:07:36 - You:

It's I don't want a job that's why I left.

  

11:07:39 - Miller Power:

All right. Yeah.

  

11:07:43 - You:

Yeah. So up next is, I can easily juggle many tasks at once.

  

11:07:59 - Miller Power:

I don't know about that one. Because like both. No, and yes. it like,

  

11:08:10 - You:

Okay.

  

11:08:11 - Miller Power:

it depends.

  

11:08:12 - You:

What does it depend on?

  

11:08:13 - Miller Power:

Well, so you couldn't write so on Monday. You can give me four things to do.

  

11:08:20 - You:

Mm-hmm.

  

11:08:21 - Miller Power:

And that's fine.

  

11:08:23 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:08:23 - Miller Power:

But I will just do them. I'm not gonna I see. Oh yeah, I'll do them. But I don't like it.

**



  

11:08:38 - You:

Right.

  

11:08:40 - Miller Power:

and one of them's do on Wednesday, and one of those, your Thursday, one of those Journal Friday, I'm gonna spend all of until Wednesday doing the first thing and then they'll be like f\*\*\*.

  

11:08:51 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:08:52 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:08:54 - You:

Okay.

  

11:08:54 - Miller Power:

So sorry. That was a bit stupid answer.

  

11:08:56 - You:

No, that's okay. I get it. Where would you put yourself on the scale then?

  

11:09:03 - Miller Power:

Mmm between I'm good at multitasking. And I know

  

11:09:08 - You:

so, in the middle,

  

11:09:09 - Miller Power:

I was asking if what the question was between. Yeah and

  

11:09:12 - You:

All right. Yes. Yeah. So it cat well. once strongly. Can you easily juggle many tasks at Greek strongly disagree.

  

11:09:17 - Miller Power:

Great. Okay. Yeah. side, but not like but not like Great. Okay. Yeah, I probably be like on the agree side but not like massive.

  

11:09:24 - You:

I think that's I think that's probably fine. I think that question is accurately kind of you're answering the way that I expected you to so even though you're not entirely sure it's mostly

  

11:09:30 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:09:31 - You:

okay.

  

11:09:32 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:09:33 - You:

I'm going to put that down. It's like a hardcore answer.

  

11:09:39 - Miller Power:

I mean it probably won't be as hard to answer for like other people because I feel like other people have a stronger sense of

  

11:09:45 - You:

I mean yeah, I'm strongly disagree. I need one thing at the time which is

  

11:09:47 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:09:48 - You:

is why I work. Well, if you're in crisis,

  

11:09:50 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:09:51 - You:

Because all of the other things have to worry about go away. Um, I I have the problem where if you give me like five or six tasks, then I will my brain decides as Infinity Because by the time I get to the last one, down the list. I forgotten the first one and I start again, just keeps going round and round. So yeah, we love that. I'm drained by social interaction and need time to reach.

  

11:10:19 - Miller Power:

I was talking about this yesterday. Yeah.

  

11:10:24 - You:

Yeah, cool. I mean that one's literally just asking you if you're an extrovert or an introvert but like

  

11:10:29 - Miller Power:

I know, but so I can

  

11:10:30 - You:

Properly because people get the people do people answer it wrong.

  

11:10:34 - Miller Power:

yeah, I mean, I can tell you why I was talking about yesterday or I cannot

  

11:10:39 - You:

now, go for

  

11:10:39 - Miller Power:

So the reason we talk about it because yeah, people have weird definitions of introvert and extrovert. And I think in the, the traditional way that people think about it, I would be like an Amber. But because I have I both I need to

  

11:10:49 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:10:51 - Miller Power:

recharge recharge from social situations, so I got that battery. But also, I need to recharge most like I need socialness to recharge like my Not going crazy battery and my happy battery, the separate batteries, but I do need a break from socializing, otherwise I'll be really tired.

  

11:11:11 - You:

Do you feel like any of the questions have asked? I didn't consider that that was a possibility where you could be both.

  

11:11:18 - Miller Power:

that's,

  

11:11:20 - You:

Do you feel like any of the previous questions have addressed that? Because there was the one in the team

  

11:11:24 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:11:24 - You:

section about social events. Help me feel part of a team.

  

11:11:28 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I think, I think that, like, sort of adequately addresses, the thing.

  

11:11:35 - You:

Okay.

  

11:11:37 - Miller Power:

because you also ask about the

  

11:11:37 - You:

I will.

  

11:11:39 - Miller Power:

camaraderie, which is also a bit that

  

11:11:40 - You:

Yes.

  

11:11:41 - Miller Power:

like, I need there to be friendliness in the five and to talk to people. So I don't go mad.

  

11:11:58 - You:

The next question is I do my best work alone.

  

11:12:02 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I do.

  

11:12:04 - You:

Okay. Yeah, I think that's fine. I think I'm does it? I don't know if it's clear enough about. Because the way that you answer that it was very clear to you that it wasn't saying, you know, without a team there to support you and it was that it was asking, you know, you

  

11:12:23 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:12:23 - You:

know, you don't want you your best workers and done in a meeting or in a pair.

  

11:12:28 - Miller Power:

Yeah, yeah. It's because, yeah, I knew exactly what you meant, unless you don't mean what I thought you meant obviously.

  

11:12:34 - You:

no, yeah, that's what I meant, but

  

11:12:35 - Miller Power:

But Yeah.

  

11:12:37 - You:

I'm worried that people might misinterpret. The other thing that the way that I could do is like because you have like, pair programming in software, which is where, like, two of you'll set up on computer.

  

11:12:50 - Miller Power:

All I can f\*\*\* off.

  

11:12:52 - You:

See, I quite like that so that maybe that's what that's probably more. I'm asking is

  

11:12:57 - Miller Power:

I don't like I don't like working on

  

11:12:57 - You:

Do you?

  

11:12:59 - Miller Power:

a team on a task.

  

11:13:02 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:13:03 - Miller Power:

Like I want to just have the task.

  

11:13:04 - You:

so, maybe it's like I I do my best. Maybe it's like I'm I'm best when working on a task with others and then you'd be like a strong disagree.

  

11:13:20 - Miller Power:

yeah, maybe

  

11:13:22 - You:

Something like that.

  

11:13:23 - Miller Power:

yeah, because I don't want people to think I'm a verse to working on a team on, on the larger project. I just don't like being micromanaged and All slash have someone interrupting what I'm doing all the time. Like if I want their opinion, I'll just go ask someone's opinion.

  

11:13:48 - You:

So I'm at my best friend working on a task in a group.

  

11:13:51 - Miller Power:

Yeah, and then I'm not.

  

11:13:52 - You:

Or with it with a group or with others, it's not hard as one.

  

11:13:55 - Miller Power:

Maybe with others.

  

11:13:58 - You:

Trying to make it really clear that I'm talking like actively working on a task rather than just like working

  

11:14:02 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:14:03 - You:

on a project.

  

11:14:04 - Miller Power:

Yeah, because all so I don't know if it implies because like I don't mind working on my task on my own in a room with a lot of people.

  

11:14:11 - You:

I don't think. Yeah, I don't think it would get

  

11:14:12 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:14:14 - You:

confusing with that, okay?

  

11:14:15 - Miller Power:

No.

  

11:14:17 - You:

I'm naturally supportive and we'll jump in to help others without being asked.

  

11:14:23 - Miller Power:

Yeah, but now no because people got cross at me.

  

11:14:29 - You:

Okay, so That was a, yeah, yes. But slightly less because it of course problems in the past.

  

11:14:34 - Miller Power:

because, Yeah.

  

11:14:37 - You:

I feel that's in the wrong category. Because that's not really about your role on the project.

  

11:14:42 - Miller Power:

No.

  

11:14:43 - You:

Either your team or your communication styles.

  

11:14:46 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:14:47 - You:

I avoid conflict at all costs.

  

11:14:50 - Miller Power:

Um, Not like a strong yes. Either like a middle or it depends if how like, At risk. I feel because again, we've got this idea of reasons that you've

  

11:15:04 - You:

Psychological safety. Yeah.

  

11:15:06 - Miller Power:

really got. Like, yourself, like, do I think I'm gonna lose my job if I do this or do I

  

11:15:12 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:15:13 - Miller Power:

If I do this or do I think I'm gonna make it hard to get promotions if I do this.

  

11:15:16 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:15:17 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:15:18 - You:

I feel a lot that was me at my last job was I would rather be fired than continue to work in this environment, so I'm going to have conflict and it'll either fix it or I'll leave them problem solved.

  

11:15:28 - Miller Power:

Yeah, whereas I you know I don't

  

11:15:30 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:15:31 - Miller Power:

like, yeah.

  

11:15:32 - You:

Yeah, I gotta. Okay, I yeah, works. I take on more work than I can handle.

  

11:15:42 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I definitely do that.

  

11:15:45 - You:

Cool. Would you care if someone was strongly disagree? If that's something you'd want to know.

  

11:15:55 - Miller Power:

Not really.

  

11:15:58 - You:

What if someone tended to end up with nothing to do?

  

11:16:03 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah.

  

11:16:04 - You:

Would you want to know?

  

11:16:05 - Miller Power:

But again, that'll be from a delegation standpoint. yeah, like if I was in charge of delegating I'd want to know if someone was

  

11:16:15 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:16:16 - Miller Power:

someone who often ended up with nothing to do, because I'd make sure they had something to do.

  

11:16:20 - You:

Want to know if one of your team members often have nothing to do.

  

11:16:24 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:16:29 - You:

Okay.

  

11:16:29 - Miller Power:

Because I generally just trust people that they'll find something to do but I don't know, everyone's like that.

  

11:16:36 - You:

I think sometimes end up nothing to do. Mostly I guess it's mostly if the project isn't right for me, I'm kind of demotivated. I won't naturally wander around and pick up new tasks and I also will

  

11:16:46 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah, but that's just I would say

  

11:16:47 - You:

never plan.

  

11:16:48 - Miller Power:

that's different.

  

11:16:49 - You:

Um well obviously opposite was nothing to do. I'd prefer if every day with the same.

  

11:17:05 - Miller Power:

I don't know about that one. Like, it's it depends what you mean like which bit of the day or all of the day or

  

11:17:15 - You:

Answer in free text. Let me know.

  

11:17:18 - Miller Power:

yeah. So The more, I don't know, maybe I just don't, I like there to be like, you know, I turn up at work. And then I say hi to like Dave and James, and Sarah. And then I go sit at my desk and I eat my yogurt and think about what I'm gonna do for the day. But then from there, it's not necessarily the same. It's sort of the setup to the day and the wind up to the day.

  

11:17:48 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:17:49 - Miller Power:

But in the middle of the day, Like, I like to have lunch a certain

  

11:17:51 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:17:53 - Miller Power:

time, but otherwise, I want to be able to pick what I'm gonna do. Depending on what mood I'm in because Like there's no point doing the same

  

11:17:59 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:17:59 - Miller Power:

thing every day, if that's not what I'm in the mood for that day.

  

11:18:04 - You:

Okay, I think that makes sense. Would you care if someone was saying? No. That okay. Yeah, this again, this is more kind of Delegation, isn't it? if someone if someone needs it to be

  

11:18:16 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:18:17 - You:

a massive variety of work, and that should be really about the project that you're on, but it is kind of

  

11:18:22 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:18:23 - You:

work as well because it's kind of your role which is kind of delegating. Mmm. Yeah. Okay. The categories need work. Okay.

  

11:18:44 - You:

Okay, next question is, I'm happy to work on a task even though we won't see the results anytime soon.

  

11:18:51 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah, I remember you talking about this and I found it really funny. Because I think we have different definitions of anytime soon.

  

11:19:00 - You:

I'm talking about this with Artie. On manual, for me, I can make a change run a command line command and it'll be on the live production website within five minutes.

  

11:19:12 - Miller Power:

Yes.

  

11:19:12 - You:

You're not going to get that with publishing in Academia, are you?

  

11:19:16 - Miller Power:

No. So like yeah cuz I remember you saying. Oh, anytime soon as a year but if I'm working on a project it might not happen for three years. like,

  

11:19:27 - You:

Yeah, I mean that's I think that's

  

11:19:28 - Miller Power:

but,

  

11:19:29 - You:

what it means. so, you know, if you're happy to work

  

11:19:30 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:19:32 - You:

on a project even though it's not going to be published for three years and

  

11:19:36 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I'd want there to be like goals

  

11:19:37 - You:

Strongly agree.

  

11:19:38 - Miller Power:

that we reach in between. but,

  

11:19:40 - You:

Yeah. it's it's very much to do with, Results in terms of value delivered to people in the computer in a software sense. So like shipping to customers I don't really I think in Academia that's really just like kind of publishing all like conferences that kind of thing.

  

11:19:57 - Miller Power:

Yeah, also like events.

  

11:19:59 - You:

Yeah, so would you be happy to work on something? Even though you were going to publish anything, you were gonna go to any events about it. You weren't going to go to any conferences for the next year.

  

11:20:10 - Miller Power:

Well, what was I doing?

  

11:20:12 - You:

But you were working on it. It just it you know you knew that it wasn't gonna be ready. Let's say you're doing. You're doing a longitudinal study that's gonna take it. Yeah, you didn't have anything to talk about.

  

11:20:21 - Miller Power:

And yeah, I'll be fine because I just go to conference for a year, but not present anything.

  

11:20:25 - You:

Yeah, yeah. Okay.

  

11:20:26 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:20:30 - You:

Is there a better way that I can phrase that?

  

11:20:33 - Miller Power:

I don't know. Yeah because it's also difficult to me because again, I'm like very goal orientated. And I don't like it when people really fast about something that's not meant to take ages, but I think it's meant to take ages. That's fine. like,

  

11:20:44 - You:

so, whereas to me, if if I didn't feel like the project was going to produce anything, actually, I'm I'm probably similar to you, but I know some people will be

  

11:20:55 - Miller Power:

Hmm.

  

11:20:57 - You:

like, you know, we want to get value delivered to customers. There's no point, otherwise very kind of it's customer oriented or value oriented. You know, what's the point? That's better to get something out early and kind of get that through, and I wasn't going to be delivered for a year.

  

11:21:16 - Miller Power:

Yeah. Yeah, I don't mind if it's like if that's just how long it takes to make the thing.

  

11:21:21 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:21:22 - Miller Power:

I just don't want to be d\*\*\*\*\*\*

  

11:21:22 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:21:23 - Miller Power:

about.

  

11:21:24 - You:

Okay, cool. That is the last of the my work slash my roll category.

  

11:21:30 - Miller Power:

Whew.

  

11:21:33 - You:

Okay. This one is a bit less, but less fleshed out. So it's about communication methods. Can you list all the communication methods used at work?

  

11:21:45 - Miller Power:

All the communication methods that I use at work.

  

11:21:49 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:21:51 - Miller Power:

Well, in Academia. Like online chat, like Discord. Sort of casual networking on like Twitter. It's like software. I find out what people are doing. And then emails for more like specific requests. Because I don't work in a physical place. So like obviously there's like if I go to a conference I'll talk to people in person but that's doesn't happen very much. Um, yeah. And then meetings,

  

11:22:31 - You:

So is that like in person meetings?

  

11:22:33 - Miller Power:

they're normally on Zoom, because Everyone's everywhere.

  

11:22:37 - You:

Yeah. Okay. Is that voice calls or video? Yeah. Or is it does it vary?

  

11:22:47 - Miller Power:

And it varies I prefer video chat but I also voice calls happen.

  

11:23:01 - You:

Or charge 86 pounds, but Amazon.

  

11:23:03 - Miller Power:

What?

  

11:23:05 - You:

For AWS, I think probably to run manual for me.

  

11:23:08 - Miller Power:

The.

  

11:23:09 - You:

I wonder why I hope it's this account.

  

11:23:11 - Miller Power:

Rep.

  

11:23:12 - You:

It is. I thought I was in the free tier Plus have a look at that. Figure out why I'm being charged money anyway. I'm going 86 pencil like $10,000. AWS does have a tendency to do that. Um, yeah. Okay, we've got instant messaging social media emails, face to face video calls and video chat video calls, sorry, voice calls and video

  

11:23:36 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:23:37 - You:

calls.

  

11:23:37 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:23:38 - You:

Is that everything that you use?

  

11:23:46 - Miller Power:

Probably. And Just like, it's because I like because I don't work in a formal workplace at the moment, so it's just difficult.

  

11:23:55 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:23:56 - Miller Power:

But yeah, I think, I think that was reasonably cover it.

  

11:24:00 - You:

Cool. And you think of some kinds of communication, so some kind of different contexts, which communication could be happening. So maybe it's, you know, kind of, that's like social event or maybe like delegation or for praise or for different types of communication.

  

11:24:26 - Miller Power:

Yeah. of casual sort of kind of networking casual sort of kind of networking Yeah. Well I mentioned like the sort of casual sort of, kind of networking friendly just like catching up. What, everyone's what, what the vibe is in in the world of your work. The thought. Yeah. Then there's like yeah, specific asking for something specifically. like asking someone to prove read something or asking if I can be in an event or asking someone if they'll be in my event or like something like that I can write like

  

11:24:56 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:24:57 - Miller Power:

Specifically, I'm asking. yeah, see I don't get a lot of like I suppose I get feedback on articles. So yeah, I guess like feedback on my work. and then, I know I'm not often given to ask at the moment. I'm off unusually in a point of giving the tasks, because I'm

  

11:25:24 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:25:25 - Miller Power:

at that.

  

11:25:26 - You:

Yeah, that's fine. Okay, so you've got kind of casual chart and Casual networking. Oh, we're gonna sneeze Maybe.

  

11:25:37 - Miller Power:

Or.

  

11:25:38 - You:

Is that you asking you someone else?

  

11:25:45 - Miller Power:

Either way. Like people ask me or I might ask people. Like I often like would DMs. I want to be like Can I have a copy of your article and poor? Or, you know, do you want to give

  

11:25:57 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:25:59 - Miller Power:

your advice on this piece of work?

  

11:26:03 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:26:07 - Miller Power:

Now, did you sneeze away? I keep thinking that. We're we're the future and they're Past, but that's not true.

  

11:26:13 - You:

No. That would be impressive.

  

11:26:19 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:26:20 - You:

It's like chat somehow knows I'm about to sneeze. Because that'd be great. They could like warn you that you're about to die. either in game were like, call 9 9

  

11:26:33 - Miller Power:

f\*\*\*.

  

11:26:34 - You:

chance me like call ambulance.

  

11:26:36 - Miller Power:

You're about to get a piano dropped on you.

  

11:26:39 - You:

You take one step to the left. You could warn me. That's true. What about if you had upset, someone I guess. Is that a distinct? Okay, basically I guess we said what I'm gonna try and then gonna ask you to do with this is that we're making a matrix out of the methods of communication and the context of communication, I'm gonna ask you to gonna ask you to say when you want and like via which And the context of communication, I'm gonna ask you to say when you want and like via which

  

11:27:07 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah.

  

11:27:08 - You:

method

  

11:27:09 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:27:09 - You:

so, if you've upset someone,

  

11:27:12 - Miller Power:

That just doesn't, I don't know. I was outside. Doesn't happen very much. I sure do. I do upset people but they probably don't communicate it to me.

  

11:27:17 - You:

I mean the example you gave before was when you were spontaneously offering help to people and you got told not to do that, that's the kind of thing. I'm thinking of

  

11:27:24 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah. Okay yeah.

  

11:27:28 - You:

Slash done. Okay. I think the way that I would do this is I would have like, so for each, I'm gonna go through these contacts and ask you and for And for each one of the kind of communication communication methods, some of them preferred methods. Some of them will be okay And for each one of the kind of communication methods, some of them will be preferred methods. Some of them will be okay and some of them would be like, please know

  

11:27:49 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:27:52 - You:

so, Casual networking, / capture. Do you want me to go through what the methods were? I guess I can send you.

  

11:27:59 - Miller Power:

yeah, I'm not gonna remember I can

  

11:28:00 - You:

I'll send them to you.

  

11:28:01 - Miller Power:

write, you can like write them down or I can try and write them down. So, you know, to ask me every time,

  

11:28:04 - You:

I've sent them to you on a certainly on meet

  

11:28:07 - Miller Power:

I'll meet oh, I forgot that's what we were doing.

  

11:28:09 - You:

It's gone if you want.

  

11:28:10 - Miller Power:

That's what we were doing. Yeah, that's right. I've got them.

  

11:28:12 - You:

Okay, so for casual networking, catch up. How would you like that to happen?

  

11:28:21 - Miller Power:

Social media and instant messaging. And face to face. Are.

  

11:28:29 - You:

There's preferred.

  

11:28:29 - Miller Power:

Those are the preferred. I'm also. Fine with it, on the other things. I just don't particularly thrive. like that's not what would naturally go for because it feels a bit like formal

  

11:28:43 - You:

Yeah. Okay, cool. if I'm, if you're asking someone for something specific,

  

11:28:53 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:28:54 - You:

Actually, that isn't something that someone else looking at your profile would care about.

  

11:28:59 - Miller Power:

No. If someone's asking me something

  

11:29:01 - You:

That's something that you would look at their profile.

  

11:29:02 - Miller Power:

specific.

  

11:29:03 - You:

Yeah, someone's asking you some specific

  

11:29:05 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:29:06 - You:

How would you like it happened?

  

11:29:08 - Miller Power:

Um, I would expect them to email me. But I'm also fine.

  

11:29:16 - You:

Was preferred. What? How would you prefer the message to come?

  

11:29:19 - Miller Power:

Email or like some kind of message. It could be a message on social media. There needs to be something that I have like a hold of.

  

11:29:26 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:29:28 - Miller Power:

That's not going to run away.

  

11:29:30 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:29:30 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:29:34 - You:

Is there any ways you don't want to happen?

  

11:29:39 - Miller Power:

I'm see so face-to-face. Voice calls and video calls are fine if it's a meeting because I'll write it down, but if they're just like if we're just chatting then, please don't do that.

  

11:29:48 - You:

Okay, so no. guess is meat is

  

11:29:52 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:29:53 - You:

meeting a separate message, a separate method. So I imagine voice causing video

  

11:29:55 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I would say meeting.

  

11:29:56 - You:

calls are like They'll, you know, they'll get in touch with you.

  

11:30:02 - Miller Power:

Yeah. I guess a meeting is different because it doesn't matter to me. What where the meeting is?

  

11:30:08 - You:

Yeah. so, would the Which are you okay with capable networking and catching up happening in a meeting?

  

11:30:16 - Miller Power:

No. Well, like before the meeting,

  

11:30:17 - You:

Okay.

  

11:30:18 - Miller Power:

but not in the meeting like I would

  

11:30:21 - You:

Okay.

  

11:30:21 - Miller Power:

like to not be in a meeting for as

  

11:30:21 - You:

So

  

11:30:22 - Miller Power:

long as possible.

  

11:30:26 - You:

So would you put in your profile that you don't want casual networking and catching up and during a meeting?

  

11:30:31 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I guess I wouldn't want to think all to think that, oh, Miller doesn't want to chat before a meeting and find a chat before the meeting or after the meeting just in the meeting, I don't want it to be a meeting. I mean, just

  

11:30:42 - You:

So, would you want a separate method to be before a meeting?

  

11:30:46 - Miller Power:

I guess but it's getting a bit specific in it.

  

11:30:50 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:30:50 - Miller Power:

I just like yeah I would worry about putting it because yes in a meeting I

  

11:30:54 - You:

I think.

  

11:30:54 - Miller Power:

I do not want to catch up.

  

11:30:55 - You:

I don't think people generally would be that. So no.

  

11:30:58 - Miller Power:

No.

  

11:31:00 - You:

Yeah. Yeah I'm gonna be like, yeah, what do you the weekend like halfway through a meeting while you're busy having a debate.

  

11:31:03 - Miller Power:

Oh, they f\*\*\*\*\*\* do. Yeah.

  

11:31:07 - You:

Today. But you know what, to say, no or how would you phrase this?

  

11:31:10 - Miller Power:

I don't know because I don't want people to think. I'm not interested in their lives if we're having a meet, right? So okay.

  

11:31:15 - You:

I guess so, something to mention is that all of these sliding scales, you will be able to add like text comments.

  

11:31:20 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I guess I would probably put a

  

11:31:22 - You:

Works fine.

  

11:31:22 - Miller Power:

comment then I just don't want to, like, have a meeting interrupted because like honestly, I've been in me, is and like people be like well, I sometimes I do it like I go off on a tangent but sometimes people do it and then we'll just start

  

11:31:32 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:31:33 - Miller Power:

talking about their lives. They were like oh my dog did something like that the other day and they'd be like hahaha, what's your And then we'll just talk about the And then we'll just talk about the

  

11:31:42 - You:

Like you and tell.

  

11:31:43 - Miller Power:

dog for like 10 minutes and genuinely eat my soul.

  

11:31:44 - You:

Yeah. Okay.

  

11:31:45 - Miller Power:

whereas if like, I go on a bit of a

  

11:31:46 - You:

So would you

  

11:31:47 - Miller Power:

challenge and it's normally it's relevant. What the fox going on?

  

11:31:50 - You:

Yeah. So would you put it under? No. And then leave a comment to say it's okay before the meeting.

  

11:31:56 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:31:57 - You:

Okay.

  

11:32:08 - You:

People ask me for something specific meetings. Are you okay with asking you for it during a meeting?

  

11:32:16 - Miller Power:

That's all right now.

  

11:32:17 - You:

Is that preferred or is it just okay?

  

11:32:19 - Miller Power:

It's just, okay. I'd rather than message me so that I have a better record of it, but I'm also fine to just write them down to meetings.

  

11:32:29 - You:

Criticism of your work. Where would you prefer to receive criticism?

  

11:32:38 - Miller Power:

Uh, email. Face-to-face is fine as long as it's like, but I don't want someone just to casually come up to me and be like, your s\*\*\*. Uh, email. Face to face is fine as long as it's like, but I don't want someone just to casually come up to me and be like, your s\*\*\*.

  

11:32:53 - You:

To assume constructive criticism.

  

11:32:55 - Miller Power:

Yeah. I don't know.

  

11:32:58 - You:

Face to face within the okay

  

11:32:58 - Miller Power:

I

  

11:33:00 - You:

category.

  

11:33:01 - Miller Power:

I guess. Oh, I don't know. Yeah, yeah so email is the most ideal.

  

11:33:07 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:33:08 - Miller Power:

And we, yeah. As instant messaging can also go an ideal. Because then I have a record of what

  

11:33:15 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:33:15 - Miller Power:

they said. And then okay. Yeah, face to face or voice calls or video calls and then I don't really want because I, I don't. I'm less okay with constructive criticism and a meetings. That's not normally also meetings for

  

11:33:32 - You:

Next. Yeah. Oh God. Imagine it is. This means everyone how s\*\*\* Miller

  

11:33:36 - Miller Power:

it's

  

11:33:38 - You:

is. We messed up. I think that social media you don't want to criticism on social media.

  

11:33:45 - Miller Power:

when I don't want to tweet saying Miller is s\*\*\*.

  

11:33:49 - You:

Subtreating, you about s\*\*\*, you workers.

  

11:33:50 - Miller Power:

I've been some tweeted. I don't like it personally.

  

11:33:53 - You:

Oh yeah. Me too. I'm a very upset that I said, the abortion with political issue. That was a fun time. Okay, praise receiving, praise. Is that different criticism or

  

11:34:13 - Miller Power:

Yeah, it's different. I think

  

11:34:14 - You:

Yeah. Okay, where would you prefer to receive prayers?

  

11:34:18 - Miller Power:

um, don't mind be nice to me anywhere. Because I don't need to make a note

  

11:34:26 - You:

You just have a preference.

  

11:34:27 - Miller Power:

of Praise. I'll just, I mean, maybe I should to

  

11:34:29 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:34:30 - Miller Power:

make me feel better about myself but I don't

  

11:34:32 - You:

Gotta go to that if you performance review. I turned up to my performance review with it, like one and a half thousand line Chase on object. But every time that I'd achieved like mission statements of the company, I still didn't get really give me the promotion. Couldn't believe it. Well, so I left. That's yeah, I have done about here. What was it known books? I tend to game the system.

  

11:35:01 - Miller Power:

That's true. um,

  

11:35:06 - You:

What's what's your opinion of praise and twitch chat?

  

11:35:09 - Miller Power:

that that's fine.

  

11:35:10 - You:

Okay, so you just don't really have a

  

11:35:10 - Miller Power:

Oh, thanks Liv.

  

11:35:15 - You:

preference. I mean is there just no preference?

  

11:35:17 - Miller Power:

No. I don't mind where people are nice to me, whereas I suppose other people are like, getting embarrassed of. People are nice to them publicly, but I don't give a yes,

  

11:35:25 - You:

I'd probably. Yeah, I'd probably think I just take it into messaging for everything.

  

11:35:33 - Miller Power:

So if I have anything nice to say about you, I should text you.

  

11:35:36 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:35:36 - Miller Power:

Yeah. Okay.

  

11:35:39 - You:

If you've upset someone, I've done something wrong.

  

11:35:44 - Miller Power:

Probably like yeah, instant messaging. This preferred. Steve was just curly Miller start concert. So I'm getting started.

  

11:36:04 - You:

We can take a break if you want.

  

11:36:05 - Miller Power:

It's okay. Yeah. It's the messaging is preferred. and then face to face, no. Email is fine. And everything else? I know. I mean, I don't want to say now because if someone wants to tell me face to face because that's their preferred method, that's fine, really, it's just it, I would be uncomfort, I would be in my element.

  

11:36:35 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:36:36 - Miller Power:

I mean, I was in the element one

  

11:36:36 - You:

yeah, I think that's

  

11:36:37 - Miller Power:

told they did something wrong but you know

  

11:36:39 - You:

Yeah, I think that's what most people think. That's kind of what no means is. I would prefer you not to do this.

  

11:36:45 - Miller Power:

Yeah, but like, I will if that's what

  

11:36:46 - You:

It's

  

11:36:47 - Miller Power:

has to happen.

  

11:36:47 - You:

yeah, I think the cat, yeah.

  

11:36:48 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:36:50 - You:

People who are going to ignore this will ignore it anyway.

  

11:36:53 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:36:55 - You:

That's yeah. Okay. What languages do you speak?

  

11:37:02 - Miller Power:

English.

  

11:37:06 - You:

Cool. Just beginning in the languages.

  

11:37:09 - Miller Power:

I speak beginner British sign language.

  

11:37:16 - You:

But the other is there a sensible scale of how good you are at a language in this context?

  

11:37:23 - Miller Power:

Oh well, it's tricky in it because I feel like everyone's got different ideas of what beginner means and what?

  

11:37:28 - You:

Mm-hmm.

  

11:37:29 - Miller Power:

yeah, I feel like you'd have to make one people would just have to decide what they think of it because like that's just what scales are

  

11:37:33 - You:

Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

  

11:37:40 - Miller Power:

But yeah, I suppose I'd say I'm fluent in English and I'm a beginner at be yourself.

  

11:37:45 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:37:57 - You:

Well. You don't want to break. I realize we've been going for a really long time.

  

11:38:07 - Miller Power:

Well, I don't know how much have you got left.

  

11:38:09 - You:

We are. Probably f\*\*\*\*\*\* like halfway.

  

11:38:13 - Miller Power:

Let's have a break.

  

11:38:14 - You:

Yeah. It's really f\*\*\*\*\*\* long, isn't it? I mean, we are talking about it. Hopefully won't be this long.

  

11:38:21 - Miller Power:

Yeah, shouldn't be this long because

  

11:38:21 - You:

Finish. But

  

11:38:22 - Miller Power:

like I don't know when when I was doing the quiz was down yesterday. They wanted to talk about every answer they put so just like

  

11:38:28 - You:

yeah.

  

11:38:28 - Miller Power:

sure about any of the answers. So, it took ages, whereas, when I did the same quiz, it took me like three minutes. Because I just press the answer.

  

11:38:33 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:38:34 - Miller Power:

So, Yeah.

  

11:38:36 - You:

Yeah, maybe yeah, maybe I always have like, you know, when you're signing up it's like how long of a quiz do you want?

  

11:38:41 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:38:42 - You:

That kind of thing.

  

11:38:45 - Miller Power:

because I know you could always say,

  

11:38:45 - You:

Or even like let you skip Andrews.

  

11:38:47 - Miller Power:

you can always be like, can I just do the quick intro quiz and then later be like, I want to expand my profile.

  

11:38:51 - You:

Yeah, that's the other thing as well.

  

11:38:52 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:38:54 - You:

It's like, I was gonna have it. So you won't just picking. You know how, like you were? Just answering the question. You're also saying like, how important this was for someone to know about you.

  

11:39:04 - Miller Power:

Yeah, that's smart.

  

11:39:05 - You:

because then, you know, in the When people view your profile a little filter to just the most important stuff.

  

11:39:12 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:39:13 - You:

which if they're logged in, will be the stuff that basically you've both said is important and you differ on

  

11:39:21 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:39:22 - You:

Well, maybe, maybe not everything will differ, maybe something should be similar in that buttheads. Anyway, right? That's going to break. How do you want 10 minutes? 15 minutes.

  

11:39:32 - Miller Power:

Can, Yes, somewhere between that we'll say 10 but that I might be 15.

  

11:39:37 - You:

Okay, we'll be back shortly after 10 to I'll see you all soon.

  

11:39:40 - Miller Power:

Yeah. oh,

  

11:39:48 - You:

I am just gonna leave this. All on. So, obviously soon.

  

11:39:53 - Miller Power:

Are you talking to me? I already left.

  

11:52:11 - You:

Hey. Okay. Ready to be on stream?

  

11:52:17 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:52:19 - You:

Cool. Hello, we're back.

  

11:52:24 - Miller Power:

I,

  

11:52:25 - You:

Hope you had a nice break. Or at least a break.

  

11:52:30 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I had a sunk some songs.

  

11:52:33 - You:

Nice.

  

11:52:34 - Miller Power:

and I put on some closer now where my Chewbacca for president 2012 t-shirt,

  

11:52:39 - You:

Mm-hmm.

  

11:52:40 - Miller Power:

And and I had to talk to the boy because he's not eating this food.

  

11:52:43 - You:

Oh, probably.

  

11:52:44 - Miller Power:

Yeah, poor boy.

  

11:52:46 - You:

Oh, you can't remember.

  

11:52:48 - Miller Power:

Oh, Rev. They didn't need to know all about anyway.

  

11:52:55 - You:

Yeah, I can't believe you tell me a little secrets.

  

11:52:57 - Miller Power:

I know.

  

11:53:00 - You:

Okay, I'm going to come straight back into some questions, if that's all right. These ones should be a bit quicker. I expect people to respond quickly to my messages.

  

11:53:15 - Miller Power:

And no.

  

11:53:17 - You:

Cool. I respond quickly to people's messages.

  

11:53:23 - Miller Power:

It's variable.

  

11:53:25 - You:

Would you want to know those two things about someone?

  

11:53:28 - Miller Power:

I would want to know if someone doesn't respond quickly. And yeah, I guess I'd want to know if someone wanted to respond quickly, but like, I wouldn't like, go out of my way to like make an effort. It's just good to keep

  

11:53:39 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:53:39 - Miller Power:

So yes, I would want to know those things.

  

11:53:43 - You:

And if you're going to call me, you should message first.

  

11:53:47 - Miller Power:

yes, I won't pick up the phone unless you tell me you're calling

  

11:53:50 - You:

Yeah. Does that apply to voice calls as well? Like video calls?

  

11:53:53 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:53:54 - You:

Yeah. and you'd want to know that about someone probably not that relevant to you because you just message him anyway as you

  

11:54:00 - Miller Power:

Yeah, but yeah.

  

11:54:01 - You:

But, if you weren't that, then you would want to know. Cool.

  

11:54:04 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:54:05 - You:

so that's one of those where actually You know, we don't I don't like show you. If you were doing someone's profile, I would only show you that if you were the one who wasn't gonna message and they wanted you to that kind of thing. You know, we can kind of use this to the 10 whether or not it's relevant to show. Cool, that's good. I found it easy to switch between different tasks

  

11:54:39 - Miller Power:

yeah, again it's as complicated because I I do find it easy to switch between different tasks but like not, if I'm like, Hyper focused on a task but no one's to know what I might

  

11:54:51 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:54:51 - Miller Power:

So like,

  

11:54:53 - You:

Yeah. So that's always one way you could

  

11:54:56 - Miller Power:

So probably.

  

11:54:57 - You:

use the comment as a kind of

  

11:54:57 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:54:58 - You:

of of usually. Yes, I'll let you know, if not, I think I'd be similar.

  

11:55:01 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:55:04 - You:

Okay, cool. I enjoy small talk. Actually oh sorry that previous question. I find it easy to switch between different tasks. That's the need one to know about someone.

  

11:55:16 - Miller Power:

Again. Yeah, I suppose I would cuz I want to know if it's okay to interrupt them to get them to come, do something else.

  

11:55:21 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:55:22 - Miller Power:

because I've definitely like

  

11:55:23 - You:

But it.

  

11:55:23 - Miller Power:

with people where you interrupt them and they're just like, no,

  

11:55:29 - You:

Would that question? Be better if it was more explicitly about being interrupted. If it was something like you know I

  

11:55:33 - Miller Power:

Maybe.

  

11:55:35 - You:

you know I don't want to be interrupted while I'm focused on a task.

  

11:55:38 - Miller Power:

But it's a different question, I guess. because,

  

11:55:42 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:55:44 - Miller Power:

yeah, I don't know.

  

11:55:46 - You:

Okay. All right I've done something for me to think about at least, okay? So I enjoy small talk.

  

11:55:48 - Miller Power:

Yeah. No.

  

11:55:57 - You:

Cool. Would you want to know that about someone? I guess you'd want to know if you

  

11:55:59 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:56:00 - You:

were yes. And they would know the very least.

  

11:56:02 - Miller Power:

Yeah. But I also even though I'm a no I'd want to know if they were yes, because I don't mind. I'll like I'll make small talk.

  

11:56:07 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:56:08 - Miller Power:

I just won't

  

11:56:09 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:56:10 - Miller Power:

I won't default.

  

11:56:11 - You:

both of you hate it, you can just sit there and silence together.

  

11:56:13 - Miller Power:

Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

  

11:56:15 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:56:17 - Miller Power:

But I don't know. It depends what you count as small talk as well because I want I I prefer of people ask me how I am but then that's that's the end.

  

11:56:22 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:56:24 - Miller Power:

That's that's fine.

  

11:56:26 - You:

it's frustrating when people send me reminders,

  

11:56:30 - Miller Power:

I remember you putting this as well, and I was like it's frustrating if I'm already doing it and it's not frustrating if I'm not doing it.

  

11:56:38 - You:

yeah.

  

11:56:40 - Miller Power:

Which they're lots of know if I'm doing it or not. So,

  

11:56:43 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:56:45 - Miller Power:

I don't know.

  

11:56:47 - You:

Would it be better if it was my supposedly asking like I would like people to remind me of things if they think I forgotten.

  

11:56:52 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I'm fine with people. Like I don't know if I actively want people to but I'm fine if they do if I'm obviously forgotten because like I was also, it's not always really obvious if I forgotten something

  

11:57:05 - You:

And yeah, I'd like people to remind me. Send me a reminder. Think if they think I forgot.

  

11:57:12 - Miller Power:

Yeah. Yeah.

  

11:57:14 - You:

Because then you can be in the middle to say, like I don't mind, whereas, I think I'd be like, yes, God, please send me a reminder because I will to feel comfortable. Sending me those

  

11:57:24 - Miller Power:

Exactly. I want people to feel. Okay, sending them with their really like worried, but like

  

11:57:28 - You:

Um, yeah.

  

11:57:30 - Miller Power:

I don't like need them. Really.

  

11:57:32 - You:

Would you want another about someone I guess. Yes.

  

11:57:34 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:57:35 - You:

To know whether or not send them? I can talk too quickly for people to keep up. that's, I think that's a problem. That's just me to be honest. should be more in the known books section.

  

11:57:47 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I think people are like that but it's it's more specific than a lot of the other questions.

  

11:57:52 - You:

There's a lot of yeah, you can ask a lot of very similar question, you know, like language barriers and accent and do you go too slow you know?

  

11:57:59 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:58:00 - You:

Do you tend to over explain you tend to under explain? Whereas I think I don't want to just have a massive list of negatives and like how much are you all of these negatives?

  

11:58:08 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:58:09 - You:

Okay. I'm a good listener.

  

11:58:22 - Miller Power:

I'd say generally I am but like you have to be talking to me when I'm listening. Like, I'm not a good listener if you just talk up cup, walk up to me and start saying stuff.

  

11:58:35 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:58:35 - Miller Power:

Because oh,

  

11:58:37 - You:

Yeah, I think I'm in. It's long. As I'm as long as I realize, I'm in a conversation and I need to listen, I'm pretty good.

  

11:58:45 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:58:46 - You:

But if you just start talking, I probably won't. Listen, won't even notice you started talking

  

11:58:50 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

11:58:51 - You:

okay, I think that's probably the

  

11:58:51 - Miller Power:

Same.

  

11:58:52 - You:

kind of Middle East with a middle with a comment to kind of kind of hard to break that down more.

  

11:59:03 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I guess I probably put it more. I am but then half the comment of

  

11:59:07 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:59:07 - Miller Power:

But like yeah, I have to know that

  

11:59:09 - You:

Okay.

  

11:59:09 - Miller Power:

you're talking to me.

  

11:59:10 - You:

I think I'd probably said I'm not with the comment if any I have to know that you're talking to me.

  

11:59:14 - Miller Power:

That's Flawless. Yeah, because

  

11:59:15 - You:

Yeah.

  

11:59:16 - Miller Power:

like, picking up or what people mean

  

11:59:16 - You:

Okay.

  

11:59:18 - Miller Power:

and stuff. So

  

11:59:18 - You:

Yeah. Yeah. I'm an optimistic person.

  

11:59:25 - Miller Power:

Um, no.

  

11:59:28 - You:

Okay, would you want to know or someone wasn't?

  

11:59:31 - Miller Power:

um, you mean, do I want to know if someone was

  

11:59:35 - You:

Either way, would you want to know if someone was an optimist or a pessimist? an optimist or a pessimist is that relevant?

  

11:59:39 - Miller Power:

Yeah. But also, it's just something that I probably work out from talking to them.

  

11:59:45 - You:

Yeah. but then it's, I guess it's useful to You know, I've worked with people in the past where they've kind of self-identified as pessimists further down the line. Oh, that's why you've so critical of everything.

  

11:59:55 - Miller Power:

Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

  

11:59:59 - You:

And it's, you know, to kind of realize that it's not that it is shaded. It's just a little bit like that.

  

12:00:06 - Miller Power:

so,

  

12:00:06 - You:

Okay. Okay.

  

12:00:09 - Miller Power:

oh yeah, my alarm was going off. I don't know if you could hear it. So I said salt.

  

12:00:13 - You:

I thought you like answering your phone, that's fine.

  

12:00:15 - Miller Power:

No.

  

12:00:16 - You:

I'm a very empathetic.

  

12:00:16 - Miller Power:

Just answer my phone. I'm sorry.

  

12:00:20 - You:

That's amazed. I'm a very empathetic person.

  

12:00:27 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I would say I'm a reasonably empathetic person.

  

12:00:30 - You:

Cool. And you'd want to know someone wasn't.

  

12:00:33 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:00:33 - You:

Cool. I bring my whole self to work.

  

12:00:40 - Miller Power:

I'm just imagining that. I, I actually imagining it in a way that I would describe as a very, Steven way of like, I've brought my

  

12:00:46 - You:

You left leg in.

  

12:00:46 - Miller Power:

body to work. I didn't leave my leg at home.

  

12:00:51 - You:

Like one one hour window at all times.

  

12:00:56 - Miller Power:

oh,

  

12:00:56 - You:

You don't pay me enough for my arm.

  

12:01:01 - Miller Power:

like the percentage of living wage, they pay me the less of my body turns up.

  

12:01:05 - You:

Yeah, exactly.

  

12:01:11 - Miller Power:

What?

  

12:01:12 - You:

I bring my whole self to work.

  

12:01:14 - Miller Power:

Bring my whole self to work.

  

12:01:15 - You:

so it's kind of it's asking like, you

  

12:01:16 - Miller Power:

Well, like

  

12:01:17 - You:

know do you hide parts of yourself? Or do you kind of authentically with that? The phrasing can be better.

  

12:01:26 - Miller Power:

I, Yeah, we'll also I don't know. like it's obviously there are definitely people who are just like I myself everywhere I don't change how I act around different

  

12:01:36 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:01:36 - Miller Power:

different people, but I definitely do change how active everything people. I wouldn't say it's like to protect

  

12:01:39 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:01:40 - Miller Power:

them. for me to actually wear around different people.

  

12:01:45 - You:

I don't I think that's kind of what it's asking. What would be a better way to quit. Ask that question, it'll make it clear that I'm asking kind of You know, do you kind of act a different way around different people just kind of the same. and then different contexts, or you

  

12:02:00 - Miller Power:

Yeah, that's quite a wordy way of putting it. I don't know how I put it into a question.

  

12:02:05 - You:

Okay? I will write that down as phrasing. Is that something?

  

12:02:08 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I might think of something

  

12:02:08 - You:

Is that something you need to know?

  

12:02:09 - Miller Power:

later. Something that I need to know. Not. really, I don't know if I tell people, I've because I want people to think I was in authentic. It's like the same thing of like I

  

12:02:30 - You:

That's true.

  

12:02:31 - Miller Power:

wouldn't want people to know. I wasn't loyal to the team like

  

12:02:34 - You:

Yeah, it's like clearly is it clearly

  

12:02:36 - Miller Power:

Guys.

  

12:02:37 - You:

a positive? I know there. There's, I don't know, it's kind of a Hot Topic clearly a positive? I know there. There's, I don't know, it's kind of a Hot Topic and Tech at the minute.

  

12:02:42 - Miller Power:

Yes, not clearly positive because there's always people who are like, oh, I'm always the most authentic authentic me and then they turn up and just like everyone off.

  

12:02:49 - You:

It's a lot of. a lot of kind of tech companies are kind of is backlash against the kind of at work politics and You know, bringing that side of yourself, a lot of companies like Banning politics and that kind of thing. It's a push back against that kind of thing. And they tend to phrase. I was bringing your whole self to work and that was kind of the previous culture. And now this push against that.

  

12:03:13 - Miller Power:

So weird. Okay.

  

12:03:15 - You:

Yeah, it's welcome. Welcome to Tech we Yeah. We actively argue about politics at work and don't get fired for it.

  

12:03:25 - Miller Power:

oh, Yeah.

  

12:03:28 - You:

Okay, we'll leave that one as a kind of question mark back to it. I tend to be quite blunt.

  

12:03:42 - Miller Power:

Yeah, see I'm naturally blunt but I I mask it.

  

12:03:46 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:03:47 - Miller Power:

Um, So, it's difficult because I'm often not blunt.

  

12:03:52 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:03:53 - Miller Power:

But I suppose it's better to say that I am because if I'm tired, I will be blunt.

  

12:03:59 - You:

Would it be better to phrase that in the negative to say? would it be like, What's the opposite of bluntness? I would want to say like sensitive because it's too It's too positive. It's It's kind of that you dance around. You don't get to the point.

  

12:04:20 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I think it's easier to say I can be blunt or I tend to be one.

  

12:04:25 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:04:26 - Miller Power:

Because I just, I can be blunt rather

  

12:04:27 - You:

Okay.

  

12:04:28 - Miller Power:

than am.

  

12:04:29 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:04:30 - Miller Power:

I'm always blunt. So I'd probably just put Less on the slider, But ultimately, I can't be one.

  

12:04:36 - You:

It comes naturally to give praise to people.

  

12:04:40 - Miller Power:

yeah, I generally

  

12:04:43 - You:

I'm gonna change that. I naturally give praise to people.

  

12:04:45 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:04:47 - You:

Yeah, cool. Would you want to know if that if someone didn't is that relevant?

  

12:04:52 - Miller Power:

And yeah, because I'm, I'd want to know. Like, you know, if someone's not like crazy for me to work for my work, when I praise them all the time, I'd want to know if it's just like,

  

12:05:01 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:05:01 - Miller Power:

that's what I like. I'm like, I'm sure they

  

12:05:02 - You:

yeah, whether you work

  

12:05:04 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:05:05 - You:

Yeah. Cool. I avoid giving negative feedback.

  

12:05:16 - Miller Power:

no, unless it's like again if it's less it's like a I don't want to ruin my reputation but generally like in a

  

12:05:23 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:05:24 - Miller Power:

friendship, I don't mind giving me.

  

12:05:26 - You:

Yeah. Yeah, cool. Cool. And did you want you to want to know Yeah. Yeah, cool. And did you want you to want to know that about people, as you?

  

12:05:32 - Miller Power:

Yes.

  

12:05:35 - You:

And if someone upset me, I'd let them know.

  

12:05:38 - Miller Power:

oh,

  

12:05:40 - You:

Get right into the conflict of version here.

  

12:05:43 - Miller Power:

Yeah. Yeah, cuz I I did the life Trap quiz.

  

12:05:49 - You:

Are you conflict of Earth?

  

12:05:49 - Miller Power:

Am I? I know my life Trap is abandonment.

  

12:05:53 - You:

Oh well, it's gonna get worse.

  

12:05:54 - Miller Power:

oh,

  

12:05:55 - You:

that's if that's your concern.

  

12:05:59 - Miller Power:

um, you're just gonna bug her off in the middle of a thing. Right. Wait, hang on. The question was

  

12:06:07 - You:

If someone upset me, I'd let them know.

  

12:06:10 - Miller Power:

I try, but it's not my, I'm not great at it. I know that I should

  

12:06:14 - You:

Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

  

12:06:16 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:06:18 - You:

Cool.

  

12:06:19 - Miller Power:

like, especially at work like, with friends.

  

12:06:21 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:06:22 - Miller Power:

I'm much better. I'll just like piss someone off. like I'm always scared that.

  

12:06:25 - You:

Yeah. I'm just I'm brought back to the time but someone on our team where there was a language barrier and they we were talking about, so it's one of the like team leads us like who's gonna be here on Friday to look after the The like the deployment of the latest live version and I was like, and it's

  

12:06:47 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:06:48 - You:

it's almost like I'm here. I'm like, I'm here too, and this person responded with like hashtag me too. You clearly you clearly seen this mean me to, you can't say that.

  

12:07:05 - Miller Power:

I would just like it's myself in the middle of the office.

  

12:07:09 - You:

Yeah. Oh, I just I like, I like to have my, hey, like I realized this is like you do this deliberately, but it looks like you're trivializing sexual assault. You can't do that.

  

12:07:21 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I would definitely mention something like that.

  

12:07:23 - You:

But that's not that's not that upset me. That was the I don't think everyone understood.

  

12:07:26 - Miller Power:

Yes more. I'm better. Yeah, I'm better at pointing out of something might have set upset someone else.

  

12:07:32 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:07:33 - Miller Power:

But if somebody's personally, accept

  

12:07:33 - You:

Yeah, that's true.

  

12:07:34 - Miller Power:

me I'm a bit s\*\*\*.

  

12:07:35 - You:

Okay, cool. So I stand up for my ideas when I know I'm right.

  

12:07:42 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:07:44 - You:

And you'd want to know if someone didn't.

  

12:07:46 - Miller Power:

Yeah, because I'd want to encourage them to like I'd give them more

  

12:07:49 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:07:50 - Miller Power:

space.

  

12:07:50 - You:

Yeah. Maintaining our relationship is more important than getting the outcome I want.

  

12:07:59 - Miller Power:

And in work.

  

12:08:04 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:08:04 - Miller Power:

No. But like a soft. No. Like it depends.

  

12:08:07 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:08:09 - Miller Power:

It depends how important I think my

  

12:08:09 - You:

Cool.

  

12:08:11 - Miller Power:

version is.

  

12:08:12 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:08:12 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:08:14 - You:

Okay, that works. Well that puts you on to the end I wasn't even called. Is it a conflict styles scale? No, negotiation styles.

  

12:08:25 - Miller Power:

Mmm.

  

12:08:25 - You:

Negotiation conflict styles. There you go, that's it. The five negotiation style. So you know with our we've placed you on that with those two questions without even realizing I think

  

12:08:34 - Miller Power:

That means.

  

12:08:35 - You:

What are you? Are you a compromiser? I think you're a compromiser.

  

12:08:43 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:08:44 - You:

As opposed to a collaborator.

  

12:08:44 - Miller Power:

Probably reasonable.

  

12:08:47 - You:

Or a.

  

12:08:47 - Miller Power:

What's a collaborator? Oh like you always do one.

  

12:08:49 - You:

collaborator's way, no collaborator is I care a lot about Okay, I stand up for ideas. A lot and also maintaining our relationship is a lot more important. so, you'll go to intense efforts to

  

12:08:59 - Miller Power:

Right.

  

12:09:01 - You:

find something that is Kind of better than the sum of your two arguments. Even if it takes ages as opposed to compromisingly just like take bits of both.

  

12:09:11 - Miller Power:

Oh yes, I get bored.

  

12:09:12 - You:

yeah, and then there's like, there's like I don't know. Let's just Google it. You go. So collaborate is like strong, both compete, is my ideas are, right? I don't care about our relationship.

  

12:09:26 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:09:28 - You:

compromises, kind of Italy in both avoid is I don't stand up for my ideas and I also don't care about our relationship. I just don't want to discuss it.

  

12:09:37 - Miller Power:

I just don't want to come. Yeah, I'm probably a compromiser

  

12:09:42 - You:

And accommodate.

  

12:09:43 - Miller Power:

closer to a collaborator, but

  

12:09:44 - You:

Yeah, accommodate is.

  

12:09:45 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:09:47 - You:

kind of, it's more important than our relationship stands and I'll, I'll happily take your suggestion even even if I think it's wrong.

  

12:09:53 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:09:55 - You:

So that our relationship can survive

  

12:09:57 - Miller Power:

I'm not like that.

  

12:09:58 - You:

I sometimes take things personally during an intense debate.

  

12:10:08 - Miller Power:

Um, Yes, sometimes it depends what the debates on but also it's difficult as a marginalized person because sometimes the debate is about who I am. it

  

12:10:15 - You:

Work debate.

  

12:10:16 - Miller Power:

I work today.

  

12:10:18 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:10:21 - Miller Power:

I would say no, but like not like a really strong. No. Like I, I might get upset. Like, if you like, talk about my ear

  

12:10:26 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:10:28 - Miller Power:

idea and like, a dismissive way that might piss me off. But like Generally. I won't I won't take it personally.

  

12:10:38 - You:

I listen to my head, not my heart.

  

12:10:41 - Miller Power:

And yeah.

  

12:10:43 - You:

Yeah. Cool. So this is how to ask things off me. I need to understand why you're asking me to do something.

  

12:10:54 - Miller Power:

Um, yeah.

  

12:10:56 - You:

Cool. I can read between the lines.

  

12:11:02 - Miller Power:

Mmm. I probably say no, just to be safe.

  

12:11:06 - You:

Yeah, everything about that as well. I think I'd probably also say no because I want you to be clear. But maybe I can try but I'll probably go wrong.

  

12:11:14 - Miller Power:

Yeah, like I I I'm not terrible. Like, if someone was like asking me and like a like a psychological analysis, I'd be

  

12:11:19 - You:

if you like,

  

12:11:20 - Miller Power:

I'd be like, I'm alright, but if if I

  

12:11:22 - You:

yeah.

  

12:11:23 - Miller Power:

get a choice don't give I don't want

  

12:11:24 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:11:25 - Miller Power:

to try. I'd rather not try. Probably 11 people are watching me

  

12:11:30 - You:

I, I

  

12:11:30 - Miller Power:

answer these questions.

  

12:11:32 - You:

Can read retirement. I can read between the lines as long as you give me an explicit when Queen connection Oh, this is what I do. I need clear goals to aim for.

  

12:11:48 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:11:50 - You:

Cool. I haven't really been asking, but I see all of these are useful to know about the people.

  

12:11:56 - Miller Power:

And let's see what they were. I need to understand why.

  

12:11:57 - You:

Right.

  

12:11:58 - Miller Power:

Yeah, that's important. I can read between the lines. Yeah, I'd want to know if someone can do that on any clit. Yeah, I'd want to know all of those.

  

12:12:06 - You:

Yeah, they do have that option.

  

12:12:07 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:12:08 - You:

Mitch Yeah, I'm motivated by deadlines.

  

12:12:11 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:12:17 - You:

I benefit from praise and positive feedback.

  

12:12:22 - Miller Power:

And I definitely benefit from it. I yeah, I suppose there's some people who get like embarrassed by it. I'm not that like it definitely makes

  

12:12:31 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:12:31 - Miller Power:

me feel better about what I'm doing.

  

12:12:33 - You:

Yeah, I handle constructive criticism well.

  

12:12:38 - Miller Power:

Yeah, I like contraceptive criticism.

  

12:12:41 - You:

Yeah, and I don't celebrate my own achievements enough.

  

12:12:45 - Miller Power:

no, I don't really

  

12:12:47 - You:

Cool. And all of those things you'd want to know about someone, they're all kind of Useful, I think.

  

12:12:54 - Miller Power:

yeah, I was assume if someone was like me and said that they don't that I should help them, celebrate them, but,

  

12:13:00 - You:

Yeah. That I mean it's more for kind of a manager like to say, like this person's probably doing better than the letter on.

  

12:13:08 - Miller Power:

Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

  

12:13:10 - You:

And to kind of look for it, but also like for team members, you know, they're probably not going to talk about all the things I've been doing. Whereas if someone was like, yeah, I celebrate my own achievements. A lot, then maybe they're exaggerating

  

12:13:25 - Miller Power:

Oh, I see.

  

12:13:25 - You:

And yeah.

  

12:13:26 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:13:29 - You:

Okay, working patterns. This is all very basic I guess I'll just ask more general questions. So mentioning your time zone and your

  

12:13:36 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:13:37 - You:

I guess time zone but also oh, f\*\*\*\*\*\* current time. In that time zone.

  

12:13:43 - Miller Power:

Oh, smart.

  

12:13:44 - You:

because I always f\*\*\*\*\*\* hate knowing

  

12:13:44 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:13:45 - You:

a time zone and not knowing what time it is.

  

12:13:47 - Miller Power:

Yeah, because I have no f\*\*\*\*\*\* idea

  

12:13:48 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:13:49 - Miller Power:

not work. Now,

  

12:13:51 - You:

Working hours. So I imagine that was just going to be like a box of like seven by 24 of like hours and just like highlight when you will be around.

  

12:14:02 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:14:02 - You:

You know. I was gonna I was gonna have it as like a like so you could like left So you could like left click to say, 95% chance, I will be working during these hours right-click to say, 95% chance. I won't be working during these hours and then the other bits like I might be working

  

12:14:16 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:14:17 - You:

Because like for me it's a bit wishy washy. So I probably say like you know 95% chance I'm working like 10 till 3. And then, you know, I'm definitely

  

12:14:26 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:14:27 - You:

not working kind of before seven and after Seven. Cool. I struggled to concentrate in noisy environments.

  

12:14:41 - Miller Power:

And noisy environments. Did you say yeah?

  

12:14:42 - You:

Yeah. Cool. I need my own space in an office. So that's talking about like having your own desk rather than like hot desking or anything.

  

12:14:51 - Miller Power:

Oh yeah, yeah.

  

12:14:53 - You:

I don't mind being interrupted while I'm working, that's kind of a duplicate.

  

12:14:59 - Miller Power:

It kind of, but we couldn't really decide about that one. Could we?

  

12:15:02 - You:

so,

  

12:15:06 - Miller Power:

because, Yeah, I would have a note about it because sometimes I probably end up just putting a sign on my desk.

  

12:15:13 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:15:13 - Miller Power:

To say whether or not I was okay with being interrupted.

  

12:15:15 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:15:16 - Miller Power:

It depends.

  

12:15:16 - You:

Little traffic light.

  

12:15:17 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:15:20 - You:

And I prefer to work remotely.

  

12:15:25 - Miller Power:

I prefer to have the option. I'm more likely to apply to a job. If it's remote. Because that's easier for me but I I do like having an office that I can

  

12:15:37 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:15:39 - Miller Power:

can go to. It's nice.

  

12:15:42 - You:

Okay, is this maybe another one? Where it's actually two questions. Where it's actually two questions. Okay. Where it's actually two questions. It's like, I like working remotely. I like working in an office.

  

12:15:48 - Miller Power:

yeah, you could ask me both because I'm yeah, I think I prefer working remotely but I don't want to not ever go into an office. Or like if there's an office available, I will go to it.

  

12:16:00 - You:

Or is it maybe a Like maybe like a percentage of like, how often would you like to work remotely? And you said like 0% fully fully in an office 100% fully work from home or like somewhere in between.

  

12:16:15 - Miller Power:

yeah, maybe that I don't know, because like Yeah, like I said I would apply to a remote job and I'm fine with it being remote. It's just if there was an office there I probably go to it.

  

12:16:26 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:16:26 - Miller Power:

So I didn't miss out on like socializing and having it being part

  

12:16:28 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:16:30 - Miller Power:

of the team and stuff.

  

12:16:31 - You:

That's the difference it's for different between like remote. Okay, companies and remote first companies where if everyone's remote you kind of don't miss out on there being an office.

  

12:16:40 - Miller Power:

Yeah, exactly.

  

12:16:42 - You:

Especially if they've been like that

  

12:16:42 - Miller Power:

I like it when everyone's remote

  

12:16:43 - You:

from the start.

  

12:16:43 - Miller Power:

because then we just voice chat

  

12:16:44 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:16:44 - Miller Power:

anyway.

  

12:16:45 - You:

Yeah, so that's I'm basically only replying only applying to companies to do that.

  

12:16:50 - Miller Power:

Dank.

  

12:16:50 - You:

Because screw that. I've worked in company for, like, two of two. People are remote and these get left out.

  

12:16:56 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:16:57 - You:

Okay. That is the end of all of the slightly scale ones.

  

12:17:02 - Miller Power:

Mad.

  

12:17:04 - You:

That's mad because I was like half of the document we went through and like 25 minutes after the first after an hour and a half. But there are a lot easier questions, I guess.

  

12:17:14 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:17:16 - You:

The next section is known bugs. I don't, I'm not gonna ask you to detail all of that all of the issues that you have with yourself and how you work, because that's quite personal, but I think it's worth us. Having a conversation about it about

  

12:17:30 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:17:30 - You:

conversation about it about whether or not you put things and what kind of things

  

12:17:32 - Miller Power:

I think I'd struggle to fill it in. when I was just, It like when I was first doing it and I might try remember to put things when I remembered them, but I just, I struggle.

  

12:17:44 - You:

Yeah, would it be

  

12:17:45 - Miller Power:

um,

  

12:17:45 - You:

Would it be beneficial to have kind of suggestions?

  

12:17:50 - Miller Power:

Yeah. May yeah.

  

12:18:05 - Miller Power:

if I like, because you've also got, I'm going through some stuff, not to skip ahead. And I think I struggle to know which

  

12:18:10 - You:

Yeah. Yeah.

  

12:18:11 - Miller Power:

to put where

  

12:18:13 - You:

So, I'm going through some stuff is

  

12:18:14 - Miller Power:

that's because

  

12:18:16 - You:

for things like It's like temporary things which will be affecting your performance at the minute.

  

12:18:26 - Miller Power:

oh, right. Okay.

  

12:18:27 - You:

Things like I'm moving house, you know?

  

12:18:30 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:18:30 - You:

Or I'm pretty burnt out at the minute.

  

12:18:34 - Miller Power:

Yeah, it's just because you've put I'm a carer and I'm depressed. And some people are that for the rest of their lives.

  

12:18:40 - You:

That's true. So I think the I'm going through some stuff with more extrinsic or external and the known books and more internal So, it's more. of a Kind, like the the known bugs was more kind of like psychological. Oh, I've put to test in the other one Maybe depressed in the wrong category, though.

  

12:19:07 - Miller Power:

You know, yeah, but then I wouldn't say being depressed, is a known bug.

  

12:19:13 - You:

Yeah. True.

  

12:19:14 - Miller Power:

I just find the categories really bizarre.

  

12:19:16 - You:

Yeah. so, it's Like so it's like internal verse external factors. But then it's not factors. It's Things that you should know about me. So I guess depression isn't a thing that people need to know it's the effects of depression that they need to know.

  

12:19:40 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:19:41 - You:

But then known books are known, books is more. I think things. I think, I think, I think the distinction that I was seeing is that these were like character flaws. And these were like, Things that were inflicted on me. Obviously, I realized that, like most of this is just me telling people I've ADHD, but like, I, I tend not. I tend to view depression as a thing that was inflicted on me, and this is more just Maybe that's maybe that's just me having grown up not being diagnosed and not realizing I don't know.

  

12:20:19 - Miller Power:

Yeah. Well like so. Because you could say a known bug is that I am unpredictably exhausted.

  

12:20:27 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:20:27 - Miller Power:

but it's because I have any

  

12:20:30 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:20:32 - Miller Power:

and I don't plan on having it

  

12:20:32 - You:

so,

  

12:20:34 - Miller Power:

forever.

  

12:20:34 - You:

is this maybe known bugs is more practical. And I'm going through some stuff is more for kind of empathy. And understanding.

  

12:20:44 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:20:44 - You:

These are like, think these are like things you should know, because they will happen and affect you need to mitigate against them. And these are

  

12:20:50 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:20:51 - You:

Please understand that things might go wrong. This is why things aren't great for me at the minute.

  

12:20:57 - Miller Power:

Okay. Yeah, I just think I'd have a lot of overlap but yeah, I suppose known bugs would describe specific.

  

12:21:04 - You:

Sir.

  

12:21:04 - Miller Power:

Actions.

  

12:21:05 - You:

Specific Yeah, specific negative actions.

  

12:21:08 - Miller Power:

yeah, whereas I'm going for some

  

12:21:09 - You:

That need to mitigated.

  

12:21:09 - Miller Power:

stuff would be like the general generic like of broad why those things are true. Maybe but they don't, you know, you

  

12:21:16 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:21:17 - Miller Power:

don't have to link them up as to, which is, which, but like,

  

12:21:18 - You:

No.

  

12:21:32 - Miller Power:

I forgot to take the tea bag out of this. I wonder why it tasted like intense.

  

12:21:38 - You:

Pretty strong.

  

12:21:39 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:21:48 - You:

Okay, so the known bugs is specific negative actions that Like colleagues. To be aware of.

  

12:22:00 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:22:01 - You:

And mitigate against.

  

12:22:02 - Miller Power:

yeah, I suppose as long as bugs was, like, hearted because I feel like I think some people would be avoid would avoid describing the

  

12:22:12 - You:

Yeah.

  

12:22:13 - Miller Power:

symptoms like a disability as a bug because it would make them sad.

  

12:22:16 - You:

Yeah. So it's like maybe it's just like, you should know.

  

12:22:21 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:22:21 - You:

Well then I feel like all of this is like, you should know.

  

12:22:24 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:22:26 - You:

is it like,

  

12:22:26 - Miller Power:

I can I can see what the distinction is and I think it's

  

12:22:29 - You:

is it like, I'm sorry if It's like apologizing in advance. These things will probably happen. Here's how you handle it.

  

12:22:35 - Miller Power:

Maybe.

  

12:22:37 - You:

But then that it's a difference between I'm sorry it's the problem that we never want for solid sorry in this language, As far of like, I'm sorry, this happens, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

  

12:22:47 - Miller Power:

Yeah.

  

12:22:47 - You:

I opposed to, I apologize for doing this.

categories are at least.

I don't know what you'd call them.
