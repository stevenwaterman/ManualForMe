# The Project
- I can't work on a project that doesn't **interest** me
- I'd rather work on one big feature than lots of small ones
	- Hard to answer
- I couldn't work on a project that I thought was unethical
	- Rephrase to this
- You can't succeed if you don't finish
	- Should be phrased more clearly
	- A project can be successful even though it didn't achieve its goal
- Users generally know what the main problems are
	- Rephrased
- I need to know how things work under the hood
	- Different category?
- **Vision and direction is important**
- **In favour of postponing**
- I work best on predictable projects, where we can safely say where we'll be in a month's time
	- Broad overview is useful
	- enjoys improvising
- Better to be late or bad?

# My Team
- Work better alone but able to access support rather than having to constantly ask and tell people
- Happy to be on a team if there's subtle/no hierarchy so I can take a dominant stance in some areas without feeling like i'm breaking the system
- Open to everyone's ideas, happy to have socialness in the work atmosphere, less formal, could go on a tangent about a dog or jokes

- I work best when I'm told what to do in detail
	- Yes when not an expert
	- No when an expert
- I appreciate when people reach out and offer support spontaneously
	- As above
- I prefer when there is a clear hierarchy and defined roles
	- Should be 2 questions
- I end up talking to everyone on the team, even though we don't really work together
	- Maybe unnecessary? You'd notice
- I try to avoid team politics
- Work is work, my colleagues aren't my friends
	- I try to keep my work life and my social life separate
- I should feel a sense of belonging in my team
	- Interpreted as more about the role in the team
- You should be loyal to your team
	- Uncomfortable telling people
- I don't keep any secrets from my team and I expect them to be open with me too
	- Shit question. Make more about transparency
- My success is the team's success, and vice-versa
	- Shit question. Make more about collectivism vs individualism
- I need my contributions to be recognised


# My Work
- Not repetitive
- Need for learning and personal growth

- I'm better at starting things than finishing them
	- Rephrase to be more about when you'd want to be working
- I need a plan before I'm comfortable starting
	- Rephrase 'I wouldn't want to act until there's a plan'
- I'm most productive during a crisis
	- Rephrase to be more about energised + what is a crisis?
- I can easily juggle many tasks at once
	- Hard to answer, but managed
- I'm drained by social interaction and need time to recharge
	- Separate batteries
- I do my best work alone
	- Confusing? "i'm at my best when working on a task with others"
- I'm naturally supportive, and will jump in to help others without being asked
	- Wrong category
- I avoid conflict at all costs
	- Wrong category?
- I take on more work than I can handle
	- Wasn't obvious that the opposite was having nothing to do
- I'd prefer if every day was the same
	- Category? Delegatey
- I'm happy to work on a task even though we won't see the results any time soon
	- Phrasing - an example of time
